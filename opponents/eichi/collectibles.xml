        <title>Eichi's Tie</title>
        <subtitle>Left behind by its owner, too frustrated when the game was over.</subtitle>
        <text>Part of the Yumenosaki Academy's uniform for 3rd years. A bit small and unremarkable, be careful not to forget it when you leave the Inventory! It's easy to leave it behind when you're thinking of something else.</text>
        <unlock>Play a game where Eichi wins.</unlock>

        <title>Pink Cardigan</title>
        <subtitle>A gift inspired by something a friend of Eichi's wears a lot. Very cozy.</subtitle>
        <text>A brand new pink cardigan. Somewhat plain, even though there's a label with a designer brand on the inside of it. A gift from someone who has both good intentions and more money than sense.</text>
        <unlock>Play a game with Eichi as a female player, at a background with a cold temperature. You don't necessarily have to win.</unlock>
