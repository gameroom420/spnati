        <title>Haiku For You</title>
        <subtitle>Who knows what the future holds?</subtitle>
        <text>After the game, Mitama gave you one of her cards, with this poem written on its back. It's up to you whether it becomes true or not...</text>
        <unlock>Play a game with Mitama. The outcome does not matter.</unlock>

        <title>Master Seal</title>
        <subtitle>Useful for when you have to give yourself a promotion.</subtitle>
        <text>As a reward for your efforts, you received a Master Seal. According to Mitama, it ''allows  you to enter a more advanced class, allowing for unprecedented skill.'' She also sends a picture of how she looks in her advanced class...

How will your own clothes look after using it? Maybe it's more convenient than going shopping...</text>
        <unlock>See a small amount of Mitama's haiku. &lt;br&gt;You who seek a prize; &lt;br&gt;
rather than mindlessly grind,&lt;br&gt; 
walk alternate paths. &lt;br&gt;

(No, this one doesn't count - Mitama)</unlock>

        <title>Heart Seal</title>
        <subtitle>Sometimes, you have to follow your heart.</subtitle>
        <text>After the game, Mitama handed you a spare Heart Seal that was in her possession. Similar to the Master Seal, it allows the user to change class. However, whereas the Master Seal advanced your class, this is merely a horizontal change. &lt;br&gt; The class depends on the user; on the right, Mitama provides an example of how she would look, were she to use a Heart Seal.

</text>
        <unlock>See a moderate amount of Mitama's haiku. &lt;br&gt; Should you find yourself&lt;br&gt;pressed for more haiku to find,&lt;br&gt;targets are worth more.</unlock>

        <title>Friendship Seal</title>
        <subtitle>Great change is always sealed away.</subtitle>
        <text>This is a Friendship Seal, another class change device Mitama gave you. Specifically, this one allows the user to assume the class of someone of the same sex with whom the user has a particularly deep friendship.&lt;br&gt;For a demonstration, Mitama and Rhajat swapped her clothes. Aren't they such good friends?&lt;br&gt; (Special Thanks to onboro for the Rhajat model)</text>
        <unlock>See a high amount of Mitama's haiku. Ah, do I have to write a haiku for this? I'm pretty sure no one will see this... But, eh, whatever:  Far and wide you walked&lt;br&gt;without seeking a reward;&lt;br&gt;for that, I thank you.</unlock>
