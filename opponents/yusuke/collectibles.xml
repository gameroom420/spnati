        <title>Old Reading Material</title>
        <text>Left behind by Yusuke, this magazine is worn down, indicating that he's had it for quite some time. Perusing through the pages you notice that he's been doodling various designs for... tarot cards? There also appears to be a concise shopping list consisting of eggs, ramen, and pocky. Moving onto the final page, there's a shockingly detailed sketch of your face... but why does it have six eyes? You'll have to ask Yusuke the next time you see him. </text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Yusuke.</unlock>
