    <description>Mordred Pendragon, the bastard child of Artoria Pendragon and Morgan la Fey. Mordred has a very abrasive personality being a rebel and a tomboy who tells people how it is. True to her nature, her fate ended in a revolt against her father, in which the entire kingdom of Camelot collapsed. In a climactic last battle,  both Artoria and Mordred killed each other and settled their score. Now, Mordred is a heroic spirit waiting to be summoned by able masters in the Fate universe, where Mordred's desire is to win the Holy Grail so she can finally show her father that she can be a good king</description>
