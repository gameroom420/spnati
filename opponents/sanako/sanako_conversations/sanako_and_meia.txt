If Sanako to left and Meia to right:

SANAKO MUST STRIP SHOES AND SOCKS:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s1]: You naughty ~player.ifMale(boys and |)~girls want to get me out of my uniform already, don't you? Well you'll just have to wait.
Meia [sanako0left]: That's fine.  Even if we didn't strip at all, there's a lot to learn from the Earth of this time.
  OR [sanako0left]: It would've been worth visiting this planet, in this time, with or without uniforms.

SANAKO STRIPPING SHOES AND SOCKS:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s2]: I wouldn't mind teaching you some things with my clothes still on, Meia. But I don't think everyone else would appreciate it.
Meia [sanako01left]: You don't need to be concerned with them if they're really that rude.
  OR [sanako01left]: If they can't respect our time, they're not worth it.

SANAKO STRIPPED SHOES AND SOCKS:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s3]: Okay, I can be your after-school tutor. But to keep everyone else happy, I might have to get a little bit nude doing it. I hope that's alright.
Meia [sanako1s_left]: You're awfully worried about what we all think...
  OR [sanako1s_left]: You might lose sight of what you want if you keep trying to please all of <i>us...</i>


SANAKO MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s4]: Doesn't a uniform like this make you nostalgic for your high school days? I think that's true even if you're still in school. I remember racing home on a hot afternoon, eager to cool down any way I could.
Meia [sanako1left]: ...What are your plans for when it's over?
  OR [sanako1left]: ...What'll you do when school ends?

SANAKO STRIPPING SHIRT:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s5]: When school's all finished, the world is a girl's oyster! Or something like that. There's no helping being an adult at that point.
Meia [sanako12left]: ...That's a good way to put it.  You have to grow up whether you want to or not.
  OR [sanako12left]: ...It does come out of nowhere.

SANAKO STRIPPED SHIRT:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_s6]: But being all grown up isn't so bad. It just means you get to be cute in all new ways.

MEIA MUST STRIP HEADPIECE:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m1]: Who else thinks it's time that that Meia sharing a bit more with the class?
Meia [sanako_resp0]: ...This is more than I <i>ever</i> talk, Sanako.  What do you want?
  OR [sanako_resp0]: If you want to know something, Sanako, just ask.

MEIA STRIPPING HEADPIECE:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m2]: I just know that sometimes the quiet ones don't get enough attention. If there's something we can do to make this more fun for you, let us know!
Meia [sanako_resp01]: ...When people say that kind of thing, they're usually talking about themselves.
  OR [sanako_resp01]: I'm fine.  <i>You're</i> the one concerned about fun.

MEIA STRIPPED HEADPIECE:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m3]: Forget your troubles and let's get comfortable, okay? We'll turn that frown upside down in no time!
Meia []: ...It should be interesting, at least.
  OR []: ...I'm sure I'll learn something.


MEIA MUST STRIP ARMOR:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m4]: Meia, would you mind if I asked how you keep yourself so especially trim? Are you on a special diet, or do you just burn off all those calories throughout the day?
Meia [sanako_resp1]: ...Training's what you could call my hobby, Sanako.
  OR [sanako_resp1]: Sanako?<br>...I try to eat lean and train hard.  But it's really just how I spend my free time.

MEIA STRIPPING ARMOR:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m5]: Sometimes I wish my job was a bit more physical. After baking, housework, running the store, tutoring, preparing meals, it's just so hard to find the time for something extra.
Meia [sanako_resp12]: You're just always helping others instead of worrying about yourself.
  OR [sanako_resp12]: It <i>is</i> selfish to always work on myself.  Maybe you've got the opposite problem.

MEIA STRIPPED ARMOR:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m6]: But I think no matter how much training I did, I'd never be as lithe as you are, Meia.
Meia []: ...I certainly burn off all my fat.
  OR []: ...Too much of a good thing, maybe.


MEIA MUST STRIP BODYSUIT:
Sanako [sanako_meia_sm_m7]: You seem so comfortable in your own skin, Meia. Not all girls could say the same.

If Meia to left and Sanako to right:

SANAKO MUST STRIP SHOES AND SOCKS:
Meia [sanako0]: Most girls our age don't seem as mature as you, even when they're stuck as pirates.
  OR [sanako0] You're calm for a civilian schoolgirl.  You've hardly raised your voice.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s1]: Who, me? I try not to let my emotions get the better of me, so I'm glad to hear that it's working. Just please don't say anything cruel, okay?

SANAKO STRIPPING SHOES AND SOCKS:
Meia [sanako01]: They say that's what makes a good leader.  Maybe your classmates feel like they can count on you.
  OR [sanako01]: It's a skill to not lose control.  Girls look up to you for it.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s2]: I've heard it helps a girl become a good mom too. That and warm hugs.

SANAKO STRIPPED SHOES AND SOCKS:
Meia [sanako1s]: ...Do you think I would make a good mom?
  OR [sanako1s]: ...I've <i>pictured</i> myself as a mom more lately.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s3]: I think with enough love and patience, any of us could raise our babies right.


SANAKO MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Meia [sanako1]: ...Are you here trying to get out more, before your "life begins"?
  OR [sanako1] I used to hear older girls dream about graduation...being "adults."  Is this your chance to cut loose before that?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s4]: Ah, I guess you could say that. But life doesn't end when you have responsibilities. You still get a chance to play around every now and then.

SANAKO STRIPPING SHIRT:
Meia [sanako12]: ...How do you know that?
  OR [sanako12]: ...You sound awfully confident about the future.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s5]: Oh, you know... just some maternal wisdom passed down to me.

SANAKO STRIPPED SHIRT:
Meia [sanako2s]: ...From your mother?  The captain's always telling me to relax...and enjoy life.
  OR [sanako2s]: ...The captain's always sharing advice with us, too.  "It's worth living a long life."
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s6]: Your captain is right, Meia. We're all just here to enjoy and be enjoyed, after all.


SANAKO MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Meia [sanako2]: What kinds of things do you study here?  The subjects, I mean.  You look like a good student.
  OR [sanako2]: Now I wonder what Earth teaches everyone in school.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s7]: Oh, hmmm? What subjects at school? There's Social Studies, Art, Physical Education, Home Economics, English... I'm sure there's more. There's... learning about the human body...

SANAKO STRIPPING SKIRT:
Meia [sanako23]: ...What have you learned?
  OR [sanako23]: ...Does that compare to what you'd learn here?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s8]: I'm not sure if I could learn anymore at this point. But there's still a lot I could <i>teach</i>...

SANAKO STRIPPED SKIRT:
Meia [sanako3s]: <i>I'm</i> here to learn.  Don't hesitate.
  OR [sanako3s]: We flew a long way here, so I'd appreciate if you did.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s9]: It's just tips and tricks I've picked up along the way. You've put me on the spot, and I'd be embarrassed to share them in front of everyone. Let's talk afterward, okay?


SANAKO MUST STRIP BRA:
Meia [sanako3]: Don't take this the wrong way, but...you remind me of my mother.
  OR [sanako3]: ...It's a little weird, watching you.  It's just---you're a lot like my mother.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s10]: I'm sure you had lots of moms watching over you if you grew up with only ladies, Meia. We all get to that stage eventually.

SANAKO STRIPPING BRA:

Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_s11]*: ?? -- not sure if I can fit in a comment about breastfeeding here, but this is my reminder

SANAKO MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Meia [sanako4]: Whether it's her "father," or her lover, it seems like every girl on Earth has a man who's important to her.
  OR [sanako4]: It's hard to imagine how constant men are in girls' lives here.  You probably don't even think about it.

MEIA MUST STRIP HEADPIECE:
Meia [sanako_resp0right]: I'm going to keep things simple when it's my turn.
  OR [sanako_resp0right]: You can see a lot of me already, and I don't really care to get creative with this kind of thing.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m1]: It might be mundane for you, but it's exciting for the rest of us. It's not every day we get to see a young lady sparkle in a bodysuit like that.

MEIA STRIPPING HEADPIECE:
Meia [sanako_resp01right]: ...So you'd never wear something like this yourself, Sanako?
  OR [sanako_resp01right]: ...Why don't you give it a try, Sanako?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m2]: Me? Oh, no, I couldn't. I'm not that slim anymore. I wouldn't want to stretch that lovely fabric out of shape.

MEIA STRIPPED HEADPIECE:
Meia [sanako_resp1s_right]: "Anymore"?
  OR [sanako_resp1s_right]: ...Aren't you my age?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m3]: Ahaha... I mean, um, when I was a little girl. I wore such a cute little leotard for ballet classes, but proportions are very different now...


MEIA MUST STRIP EYEPATCH (CUPID):
Meia [sanako_resp0right_cupid]: I'll keep things simple for now, but a lot of this is going to go all at once later.
  OR [sanako_resp0right_cupid]: You can see a lot of me already, so I won't drag this out later.  There's enough pieces as-is.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m1_cupid]: I've been meaning to tell you what a beautiful set it is. Fit for a showgirl!

MEIA STRIPPING EYEPATCH (CUPID):
Meia [sanako_resp01right_cupid]: Sanako?<br>...It does kind of remind me of my old idol dresses.
  OR [sanako_resp01right_cupid]: I used to <i>be</i> a showgirl, Sanako.  An idol.  I was really young, but my costumes were busy.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m2_cupid]: Aw, that's so sweet! I can just imagine you a few years younger, singing and dancing and making everybody smile!

MEIA STRIPPED EYEPATCH (CUPID):
Meia [sanako_resp1s_right_cupid]: I was a <i>lot</i> younger.  That was the problem---I enjoyed it until I didn't.
  OR [sanako_resp1s_right_cupid]: It wasn't just a few years.  By puberty, I'd outgrown it.  At least that's what I told myself.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m3_cupid]: Interests change as you get older, even if as a child you thought they never would. Who can even say what kinds of fashion you'll be into next year?


MEIA MUST STRIP ARMOR:
Meia [sanako_resp1right]: ...It's me.  I keep trying to multitask...
  OR [sanako_resp1right]: ...That's what I get for filling out maintenance requests this hand.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m4]: You know, Meia, I find that if something's worth doing, it's worth giving my full attention to. You might even start to enjoy yourself a little more.

MEIA STRIPPING ARMOR:
Meia [sanako_resp12right]: ...Maybe, Sanako, but I was never going to enjoy---<i>this</i> part.
  OR [sanako_resp12right]: ...I guess I was trying to take my mind off things, Sanako.  I mean---well, you can---see.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m5]: Oh? Ah. Well... I'm sure you weren't trying to mislead us. Those things are one-size-fits-all, I'm guessing. And so cavernous.

MEIA STRIPPED ARMOR:
Meia [sanako_resp2s_right]: ...You could say the same thing about this place.
  OR [sanako_resp2s_right]: You're right.  It's very accepting...for all kinds of girls.
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m6]: With that out of the way, I'm sure you'll be able to focus so much better.


MEIA MUST STRIP BODYSUIT:
Meia [sanako_resp2right]: ...Pyoro, have you finished your scan of the background radiation?<hr>{pyoro}This place really is what it seems.<br>...Do you wanna scan the other players?
  OR [sanako_resp2right]: {pyoro}I'm back, Meia!  Half-life analysis confirms this Earth is the predicted age.<br>...I could try it on your tablemates, too.{!reset}<hr>What do you mean?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m7]: Ah! Th-That's okay, Mr. Robot. No need to scan us. A woman can't keep her mystery if you get too much science involved.

MEIA STRIPPING BODYSUIT:
Meia [sanako_resp23right]: ...I've never kept my body a mystery.
  OR [sanako_resp23right]: ...What do you have to hide?
Sanako [sanako_meia_ms_m8]: Oh, I see. You were just trying to distract us from something more important. Nice try, missy!

MEIA MUST STRIP BRA:
Meia [sanako_resp3right]: ...My mother knew I was like this.  I just wonder if she thought I'd outgrow it, or if I'd really end up a criminal, stripping for strangers.
  OR [sanako_resp3right]: I was a troublemaker growing up.  Mom always said troublemakers end up in seedy places like this.  I wonder if she ever thought I'd go this far with it.
