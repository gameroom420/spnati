                <state img="#-pleased.png" oneShotId="35" weight="0.75">One thing I appreciate about GGO, as a gamer, is that you have to know what path your game character will take beforehand; there's no easy resets.</state>

                <state img="#-overjoyed.png" oneShotId="43" weight="0.75">Rather than levels, we have rankings in the Ordinal Scale game; the higher, the better of course. But of course skill is still very important.</state>
