                <state img="#-think.png" oneShotId="28" weight="0.75">Some games have level progression, others are skill-based... yet others manage to do both, which affects a whole bunch of game aspects, including PvP.</state>

                <state img="#-sheepish.png" oneShotId="42" weight="0.75">&lt;i&gt;(It's a shame Kazuto isn't into the Ordinal Scale game more. I worry about him not getting enough exercise, and sometimes he even forgets to eat while working...)&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-overjoyed.png" oneShotId="43" weight="0.75">Rather than levels, we have rankings in the Ordinal Scale game; the higher, the better of course. But of course skill is still very important.</state>
                <state img="#-sheepish.png" oneShotId="44" weight="0.75">I do hope Ordinal Scale has more appearances of former SAO boss monsters in the future. Even if the first event for that game nearly ended... badly, playing against familiar creatures was pretty fun!</state>
                <state img="#-overjoyed.png" oneShotId="45" weight="0.75">Although I do miss having Sword Skills, it's nice that in OS, you can practice anywhere on your own time. You don't have to throw yourself into battle.</state>
