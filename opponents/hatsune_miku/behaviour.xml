                    <text>I'm sure if y'all were aware, but today is "Miku Day!" No, it's not my birthday, but I'm very closely tied to the number 39. In Japanese, the number is sometimes called "Miku", hence my connection with the number, and the date!</text>

                    <text>So, today is "Miku Day." It's a day created by my fans to celebrate me, because in Japanese, the number 39 can be interpreted as "Miku", and that's why March 9th is celebrated by my fans!</text>
