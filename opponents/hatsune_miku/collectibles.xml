        <subtitle>Hugely Iconic!</subtitle>
        <text>As you get ready to leave the inventory for the evening, Miku comes up to you, and in her hand is her tie. Well... not her real tie. "I usually have a couple spares on hand, and I thought you could take one!" She leaves the tie in your hand, and as she walks off, she waves and says: "I hope we get to play again soon!"</text>
        <unlock>Lose a game where Hatsune Miku, at the very least, loses her tie. She doesn't have to win.</unlock>

        <title>Miku's Headset</title>
        <subtitle>An Authentic Piece of Idol Memorabilia</subtitle>
        <text>Miku tends to keep her headset on almost all the time. However, she tends to keep a spare on hand in case of backup, and thought she'd give it to you as a gift for beating her so swiftly. You're not entirely sure what you'll do with an idol headset, but you reason it could work well as a gaming headset, or something of that matter. The simple fact of the matter is: you have it in your possession, and are now free to brag about it.</text>
        <unlock>Win against Miku 3 times.</unlock>
