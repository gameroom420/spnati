                    <text>Chocolate making in Eorzea dates back to the early days of Hyurian settlers arriving in La Noscea. They harvested kukuru beans from the cliff sides on the lower shores, crushing them to combine the ground beans with the oil inside. Sugar, milk, and other flavoring is added and then kneaded into a paste which is tempered continuously until the desired consistency and structure is obtained. Merchants from Thanalan and local kobolds were eager to trade other, more practical sundries for the treat, establishing the kukuru bean as a staple crop in the region along with oranges, grapes, and olives. </text>
