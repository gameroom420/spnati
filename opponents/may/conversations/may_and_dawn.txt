If May to left and Dawn to right:

MAY MUST STRIP BAG:
May [may_dawn_fighting_solo]: Aha, you got me fair and square! I'm not so used to fighting my battles solo, you know.
Dawn [DawnMaySolo01]*: Don't worry! It's a game of chance, not skill and determination like real battles are. That being said, I'll assume you're more of a contest kind of gal rather than a battling one?

MAY STRIPPING BAG (accessory):
May [may_dawn_coordinator]*: Yep! I'm a coordinator! What gave me away? Or am I just that famous now? Haha, I wish.
Dawn [DawnMaySolo02]*: Your peppy attitude, your cute smile, the way you present yourself. Yup! You're a Cute Contest specialist, I can just tell!

MAY STRIPPED BAG (accessory):
May [may_dawn_good_start]*: I can tell I'm going to like you, Dawn!
Dawn [DawnMaySolo03]*: I try to get along with everyone, especially people who love Pokémon as much as I do!


MAY MUST STRIP SHOES:
May [may_dawn_determined_to_win]: Okay. I'll go again if it'll make you happy. Gee, everyone seems pretty determined to win, don't they?
 OR [may_dawn_determined_to_win]: Okay. I'll go again if it'll make you happy. Gee, everyone seems pretty determined to win, don't they? Well, <i>almost</i> everyone. -- variation for if Moon is playing, but uses the same marker
Dawn [DawnMaySolo04]*: What can you expect from fellow trainers like ~player~ and I? Hope you're prepared to lose to us some more! Hehe.

MAY STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
May [may_dawn_competitive_spirit]*: Oh, ~player~ is a trainer too? <i>Interesting.</i> Ahaha, that explains it. There's some competitive spirit here!
Dawn [DawnMaySolo05]*: Oh yeah, ~player.ifMale(him|her)~ and I go <i>waay</i> back. I showed ~player.ifMale(him|her)~ how to catch Pokémon when they were just starting out. From there, ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ took off!

MAY STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
May [may_dawn_rising_star]*: That's so neat! You're a rising star, ~player~. I'd better keep my eye on you.
Dawn [DawnMaySolo06]*: ~player.ifMale(He|She)~ would probably qualify to be an Ace Trainer, actually. But I should stop gushing about ~player~, we're all here to win!
  OR [DawnMaySolo06]*: ~player.ifMale(He|She)~ would probably qualify to be an Ace Trainer, actually. But I should stop gushing about ~player~, I might be a bit of a distraction to ~player.ifMale(him|her)~... -- variation for if Dawn is naked, forfeiting, or post-forfeit. Same marker.


MAY MUST STRIP BRACELET: (conditional on previous case)
May [may_dawn_player_silent]*: Now that I know that ~player~ is a trainer too, it all makes sense. Silence as a strategy. I think it's working. Dawn, you're ~player.ifMale(his|her)~ friend, right? What's going on in that head of ~player.ifMale(his|hers)~?

DAWN MUST STRIP BOOTS AND SOCKS:
May [may_dawn_nice_hat]: Hey, nice to meet you if I didn't say that earlier! I like your hat. I love meeting other Pokemon fans!
Dawn [DawnMayNiceHat01]*: Thanks! Though Pokémon fan is a bit of an understatment. I'm working towards becoming a Pokémon professor. I'm still an assistant for now, but I'm working towards my credentials to become one!

DAWN STRIPPING BOOTS AND SOCKS (minor):
May [may_dawn_professor]*: Oooh! A professor in the making! Are you studying anything in particular, or just a bit of everything?
Dawn [DawnMayNiceHat02]*: I want to study as much as I can, but right now I just have specializations in Pokémon evolution. Once I do have my credentials, I kinda want to branch out into healthcare and well being for Pokémon.

DAWN STRIPPED BOOTS AND SOCKS (minor):
May [may_dawn_field_research]*: That's so cool. If you need anyone to do some field research, let me know. I love helping out.
Dawn [DawnMayNiceHat03]*: If you happen to be in the area, I may take you up on that offer. It would be fantastic to get another perspective, especially from a coordinator.


DAWN MUST STRIP HAT:
May [may_dawn_celebrities]*: Hey, Dawn, have you ever met anyone famous through your research? Friends with any celebrities? I want all the details!
Dawn [DawnMayCelebrities01]*: Hmm... Well, does Professor Rowan count? Hehe. But to answer your question; I've only really met with gym leaders from the Sinnoh Pokémon League. Though there was that time I met Jasmine from the Johto region.

DAWN STRIPPING HAT (accessory):
May [may_dawn_jasmine]*: Not bad, not bad. Jasmine's the gym leader of Olivine City, right? I don't think we've met. You should introduce us someday. Maybe I'll introduce you to some of my friends too!
Dawn [DawnMayCelebrities02]*: Well it's not like I'm super close freinds with her, but if the opportunity presents itself, I'll gladly introduce you. I'd hope you do the same with your friends.

DAWN STRIPPED HAT (accessory):
May [may_dawn_party]*: We could have a big party! Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I have to focus on to~background.time~'s game.
Dawn [DawnMayCelebrities03]*: Hehe, trainers and contest coordinators are hardly any different from each other. We all have that determined spark that drives us. Don't expect me to let up now!

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.

If Dawn to left and May to right:

MAY MUST STRIP BAG:
Dawn [DawnMayResearch01]: Ah, you're a Pokémon coordinator right, May? I did coordinating and contests when I was younger, but I gave that up so that I can pursue a career in Pokémon research. -- Note: Please set this line to only play if the target is on the right.
May [may_dawn_professional]: Yeah, that's me! Nice to meet a fellow Pokémon professional. So which of my Pokémon did you come here to research?

MAY STRIPPING BAG (accessory):
Dawn [DawnMayResearch02]*: Aha, I'm just here to play some strip poker just like you are. Besides, I specialize in Pokémon evolution. More so researching why some Pokémon evolve and others don't. And the energy released when evolution does occur!
May [may_dawn_study_focus]*: Oh, awesome! That's a really cool focus. Any details you can share before your research is published?

MAY STRIPPED BAG (accessory):
Dawn [DawnMayResearch03]*: Hmm... Nothing that isn't publically available, but I do have an interesting tid bit I can share. It would seem that some Pokémon from ancient times actually <i>lost</i> their ability to evolve! Can you believe that?
May [may_dawn_how_mysterious]*: Whoa, really? I wonder what caused that. How mysterious!


MAY MUST STRIP SHOES:
Dawn [DawnMayStar01]: So I gotta ask, who was your star Pokémon in contests? My Bidoof was a real cutie on the stage! He still is actually. -- Note: Please set this line to only play if the target is on the right.
May [may_dawn_star_pokemon]: My Blaziken has probably won me the most ribbons, but don't underestimate my Beautifly! We can have a bit of fun with them after the game if you like.

MAY STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
Dawn [DawnMayStar02]*: If it's a battle you're looking for, I would be happy to oblige! Unless there was something else you had in mind when you said "fun"? -- Note: Dawn is an awkward flirt, she understood May's statement. She just wanted to tease.
May [may_dawn_just_a_battle]*: Uh, haha, yeah... I just meant a battle. Let's play it by ear. If you're feeling like some action later, I'm always down for it.

MAY STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
Dawn [DawnMayStar03]*: Hehe, alright. I'm sure there'll be enough time for me to have a battle after this. Just know I won't make it easy.
May [may_dawn_on_top]*: I don't go down easy either! But no matter who comes out on top, I'm sure we'll have fun!


MAY MUST STRIP BRACELET:
Dawn [DawnMayBeaches01]: So May, I know Hoenn is a lot warmer than Sinnoh is so I gotta ask. What are the beaches like over there? Where do you think would be a great place to visit for me?
May [may_dawn_beaches]*: The beaches are <i>so</i> nice! Depending on how long you're staying, Dewford Town is fun and it has some hot surfers too. I'm going broke buying so many swimsuits each month!

MAY STRIPPING BRACELET (accessory):
Dawn [DawnMayBeaches02]*: Dressing to impress while on the beach can easily break your bank. But how often do you turn heads when you show up with a new swimsuit?
May [may_dawn_turning_heads]*: All the time! When I'm wearing a new two-piece, the ~player.ifMale(boys|beachgoers)~ just can't look away. I'm hoping it'll turn into some first dates if I find the right look.

DAWN MUST STRIP BOOTS AND SOCKS:
Dawn [DawnMayNewBoots01]*: Crud. Well, if it's any consolation, these boots have gotten me across forests and mountains alike. I should consider getting new ones, the soles on these ones are almost completely worn out.
May [may_dawn_bicycle]*: Good walking shoes are so hard to find! The cute ones never last, do they? Have you considered saving up for a bicycle, Dawn? I used to ride one all the time when I was younger.

DAWN STRIPPING BOOTS AND SOCKS (minor):
Dawn [DawnMayNewBoots02]*: I had a bicycle when I was younger, but now it's a little old and I'm frankly too big for it now. Plus, bikes also tend to not work so great in the snow.
May [may_dawn_bike_shorts]*: Oh, right. The snow. That's a shame, because I think you'd look pretty cute in bike shorts, Dawn.
