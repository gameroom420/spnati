If Cynthia to left and May to right:

CYNTHIA MUST STRIP COAT:
Cynthia [MayRivalries1]*: It's great that we can enjoy this game without being too competitive. I know that in battles and coordinating, people can become hypercompetitive and start rivalries as a result.
     OR [MayRivalries1]*: The atmosphere in this place is a breath of fresh air compared to the competitive air in the Pokémon League. Everyone here is much more relaxed and subdued. in contrast, rivalries are commomplace in the competitive Pokémon scene. 
May [MayRivalries1_resp]*: Sure, it's not very competitive... <i>yet</i>. You're still fully dressed, Cynthia! I can be your rival later when the stakes get higher if you want.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING COAT (minor):
Cynthia [MayRivalries2]*: I suppose a friendly rivalry wouldn't do much harm, even if it's a bit of a contradictory statement. I do wonder, have you had a friendly rival in the past?
     OR [MayRivalries2]*: I would presume you're proposing a friendly rivalry, hmm? Would it be unreasonable of me to assume that you have prior experience when it comes to friendly rivalries?
May [MayRivalries2_resp]*: Sure, I've had plenty of friendly rivals! They can really keep you on your toes in a contest! What about you, Cynthia? Any rivals you'd like to beat the pants off?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED COAT (minor):
Cynthia [MayRivalries3]*: Not anyone in particular. Although for this occasion, you can all be my rivals. It would be satisfying to see all of you naked... Satisfying from a competitive standpoint, I mean, not a sexual one...
May [MayRivalries3_resp]*: Sure, sure. But hopefully both!


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SCARF:
Cynthia [MayTrainer1]*: I'm curious if you've had any rivals in the past, May. Nowadays, everyone seems to have a rival trainer, even if it's a bit of a friendly rivalry.
     OR [MayTrainer1]*: People your age always seem to have a rival trainer, May, be it a competitive rivalry or a friendly one. Care to share your story about your rival?
May [MayTrainer1_resp]*: Have you ever met a gym leader named Whitney? She challenged me to a swimsuit competition, and the judges said <i>she</i> won! The next time I see her, I want a rematch! How about you, Cynthia? Any rivals you're itching to beat?

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SCARF (accessory):
Cynthia [MayTrainer2]*: Not a rival per se, but I wouldn't turn down an opportunity to battle with Lance. It takes a lot of skill to be able to be the League Champion of two regions.
     OR [MayTrainer2]*: Among the list of people that I would like to engage in a battle, Lance would at the top. He must be a one-of-a-kind trainer to be able to remain League Champion of two regions simultaneously.
May [MayTrainer2_resp]*: You've got your sights set high, not that I'm surprised! And if the battle doesn't work out, you can always challenge him to poker.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED SCARF (accessory):
Cynthia [MayTrainer3]*: Regular poker or Strip poker? He never struck me as a man who would partake in a gambling game, or a lewd game either. Her cousin though, she might be a bit more adventurous...
     OR [MayTrainer3]*: I'm not really sure if he's the type to participate in either forms of poker. I just can't see him agreeing to play a game like this. Although, the same can't be said for his cousin...
May [MayTrainer3_resp]*: You mean Clair, right? Yeah, she might be into it! You never know if you don't ask! Don't you want to see Lance with his shirt off? Clair probably doesn't, but I do!


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Cynthia [MayInvite1]*: I wouldn't mind playing another game like this. If you can invite one person, any person, to come with you in another strip poker game, who would you choose, May?
     OR[MayInvite1]*: I wonder who I could invite next time I come here... What about you, May? Who would you like to ask out to a game of strip poker?
May [MayInvite1_resp]*: There's a few guys I know that I'd <i>really</i> love to take down a peg or two, y'know? But there's a big risk that it might blow up in my face! Hmmmm. Maybe... Skyla? She seems fun. What's your answer, Cynthia?

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
Cynthia [MayInvite2]*: Hmm, I've never thought of an answer myself... I suppose Grimsley would be a good choice. I would expect he would quite the formidable strip poker player. If anything, this game has lower stakes than his usual games.
     OR [MayInvite2]*: That's a tricky question... but I would have to pick Grimsley. Aside from his skill with cards, it would be quite easy for him to maintain his composure, given the lack of money in this game.
May [MayInvite2_resp]*: Yeah, but do you really want to see Grimsley with his junk out? No offense, but he should keep it in his pants.

CYTHANIA STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
Cynthia [MayInvite3]*: W-what's wrong in seeing Grimsley naked? What would be your preference in men, then? Someone energetic like Brawly, or more fatherly like Norman?
     OR [MayInvite3]*: I'm somewhat surprised by your repulsion to Grimsley... Oh well, who would you prefer in terms of men? Someone wacky like Wallace, or a more serious person like Norman?
May [MayInvite3_resp]*: I don't mind an older guy, but I don't want anyone who reminds me of my dad! ~player.ifMale(If he's got enough energy to keep up with me, I'll give him a shot.|If I get set up with one more guy that tries to get all fatherly, I might just give up on guys altogether!)~


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Cynthia [MayConfidence1]*: I might not have the same confidence that some Sinnoh League gym leaders have in revealing my body, but I'm not letting this setback shatter my concentration!
     OR [MayConfidence1]*: If you think the threat of nudity is enough to take me out of my element, then you've underestimated my resolve. Even though I'm not used to revealing outfits like some gym leaders, I can say that my nerves remain steely.
May [MayConfidence1_resp]*: Wow, how inspiring! And this showing some skin is probably something you'd need on your resume anyway if you ever did want your own gym. Especially a water-type gym.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Cynthia [MayConfidence2]*: Now that you pointed it out, the female gym leaders back in Sinnoh do wear some climate-inappropriate clothing. Gardenia for example, her robe doesn't even cover her abdomen. I can't imagine wearing anything that revealing. 
     OR [MayConfidence2]*: I've never realized before, but you do have a point in reagrds to some gym leaders, May. I've always found it odd that Candice, who lives in the coldest region in Sinnoh, wears a miniskirt that exposes her thighs. My thighs and legs would freeze if I leave them exposed like she does.
May [MayConfidence2_resp]*: Maybe I'm not the <i>best</i> example of dressing for the weather, but at least I always look cute! Maybe to~background.time~ could be an experiment for you to see if wearing a bikini top would get you more fans, right?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Cynthia [MayConfidence3]*: Well, what do you think about my current look? Either way, I don't think it would really stick, given the frigid weather back home in Sinnoh. Although, I could get used to this within the comforts of my own home...
     OR [MayConfidence3]*: I think this might be a bit too bold for my liking, especially when you take into account the cold climate of the Sinnoh region. I suppose this is something that would go well within the warmth of my house...
May [MayConfidence3_resp]*: I don't know, Cynthia... It could open up a whole new fanbase for you!


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTS:
Cynthia [MayPantless1]*: This was one roundabout way of getting my pants off, isn't it? I must say I'm not used to having my legs exposed in front of other people. That's more of the forte of a Pokémon coordinator.
     OR [MayPantless1]*: Time to show off my thighs then? Pokémon coordinators are already used to this type of exposure, but it's not really often that I wear anything that doesn't cover most of my legs.
May [MayPantless1_resp]*: Haha! Good luck with your audition for coordinator then! Here's your first test: Let's see if you coordinated your underwear.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTS (major):
Cynthia [MayPantless2]*: It would foolish of me to not make my underwear look respectable, given the nature of this game. What exactly do you look for in underwear?
     OR [MayPantless2]*: That should be a given, doesn't it, with this being a strip poker game... Since you have the discerning tastes of a coordinator, what would you say is your criteria for good underwear?
May [MayPantless2_resp]*: Oh, you know, the usual: fit, style, support, sexiness, stuff like that. But I'm sure almost anything looks good on a figure like yours!

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTS (major):
Cynthia [MayPantless3]*: Well, what do you think? I didn't go out of my way to make my underwear appealing to other people, so I didn't expect much of a fanfare out of it.
     OR [MayPantless3]*: It's not something you would call spectacular or even memorable, but my underwear is very comfortable and form-fitting. Anyway, what can you say about it?
May [MayPantless3_resp]*: Oho. Well, as an expert in these matters, I can tell you that bra looks mature and deliciate with just a little bit of playfulness. Your pantyhose are sheer and professional, but they're too opaque to see your panties properly, so I can't complete my review.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTYHOSE:
Cynthia [MayLingerie1]*: Not much pressure on this one, since I presume all of you can already see what's underneath. When you think about it, it's almost as if I'm going to strip down to my swimsuit.
     OR [MayLingerie1]*: It's not like this left much to the imagination anyway. Besides, there's not much different than having a swimwear on, it's pretty much the articles of clothing.
May [MayLingerie1_resp]*: Swimwear and underwear are pretty different according to all the best magazines. Sure, maybe you're showing just as much skin, but bikinis are bought to be seen by everybody and underwear is just for the special people in your life. And, um, getting wet can be a different experience too.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTYHOSE (minor):
Cynthia [MayLingerie2]*: Well, if I'm going to wear underwear for someone special, then I would have worn something more flashier than this. My current underwear is looking somewhat plain, for a lack of better term. It's not wet though, I can say as much...
     OR [MayLingerie2]*: Don't you think my current underwear is a bit lackadaisical for a hypothetical scenario like that? Not that I would wear something completely vulgar, mind you, but it could be... more eye-catching. Well, at least it's dry for now...
May [MayLingerie2_resp]*: You're so modest, Cynthia! I can tell you only wear the best, and I bet if you took that look to any catwalk in the world, you'd be the talk of the town! Littleroot Town, at least. We used to have a little fashion parade each year.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (minor):
Cynthia [MayLingerie3]*: Hmm, Littleroot Town, eh? Maybe I should visit there next time in Hoenn... Not to show my underwear, but to simply visit a new town I've never been to before.
     OR [MayLingerie3]*: In that case, I shall visit the fashion parade in Littleroot Town soon. I should specify that I'll be attending as a spectator, and not to flaunt my underwear...
May [MayLingerie3_resp]*: I'm sure they'd all be very happy to meet you, even if you don't go to model lingerie.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP BRA:
Cynthia [MayBi1]*: I don't know how to put this, but something about the atmosphere here is making me a bit curious about women. I'm not exactly sure what to make of it. I can't really say I'm attracted at all to women... but I'm having this unusual desire...
     OR [MayBi1]*: Has anyone else felt this odd feeling whenever you're around someone of the same gender in very close quarters? It's not at all different from what I feel around men I'm attracted to...
May [MayBi1_resp]*: Whatever could you mean, Cynthia? ... I think you should talk about it more in case someone else here feels the same. I mean, um, so that we can diagnose this way you're feeling.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Cynthia [MayBi2]*: Well, it's like this feeling, where I'm hoping that a particular someone will be impressed by my display. Normally, I would expect such validation from a man... but for some reason, I want to seek your approval, May.
     OR [MayBi2]*: It's this warm tingly sensation, a strong desire to impress a particular person. Like it is my utmost mission to gain validation. I've felt this  towards a handful of men before, but never a woman... and I feel it towards you, May.
May [MayBi2_resp]*: M-Me? Well, maybe you're just evolving, Cynthia. Maybe you're turning into someone who would, y'know... go on a date with me sometime?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Cynthia [MayBi3]*: A date? I suppose that might help me determine if my current feelings are genuine or a mere product of my current predicament... Although, you shouldn't expect too much, or even expect anything to develop out of this, but we shall see...
     OR [MayBi3]*: I must say that the prospect of going on a date with you is making my heart pound, but I worry that this is solely due to the emotional tension in the air. Even if it doesn't work out, we can still be friends, right?
May [MayBi3_resp]*: <i>(Did she just say yes? What?! Did that actually work? Is this real life?! What will I wear? Does she really like me? What if she wants to go to a love hotel?! How can I tell her I've never done this before? Can she tell I'm freaking out?)</i><br>Neat.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Cynthia [MayDate1]*: So, it comes down to this. I never would have known I would do such a thing, but that's what this game is all about, right? Who knows what other new experiences I'll get to have, and not just in the context of this game. The ~background.time~ is still young.
     OR [MayDate1]*: Standing nude in front of other people is not something I've ever done before, but that's why I attended this game in the first place. With the way things are going, this might not be the only thing I'll get to experience for the first time before the day is over.
May [MayDate1_resp]*: What you do depends on what you're open to, and I'm sure we'd be willing to help you achieve some firsts if that's what you want. I would, at least.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Cynthia [MayDate2]*: Being in a relationship, let alone with another woman, would already be a first for me. We should start with that date you proposed earlier, and see where it goes from here. I know of a diner not far from here that we can go to after this game.
     [MayDate2]*: That date we discussed earlier would be another first for me, and not just because it's with another woman. I'm strongly looking forward to it, so much so that I think we should go straight to the nearby diner and get on with it as soon as we're done here.
May [MayDate2_resp]*: Sure! I just need to go change first. And, ah... I think you do too...

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Cynthia [MayDate3]*: Well, I can't be naked like this on our date, right? That's something that we save up for <i>after</i> the date... Or maybe forget that I said that. The excitement is getting to my head. 
     OR [MayDate3]*: Standing naked like this while reminiscing about our date, I'm beginning to wonder it this wouldn't be the last time I'll be naked with you... Ah, I'm getting too carried away! What, with me letting my thoughts get too vocal.
May [MayDate3_resp]*: <i>(Somehow I totally flipped her switch! How the heck is it that Cynthia and I might actually get together and</i> she's <i>the horny one?!)</i>

---

MAY MUST STRIP BAG:
Cynthia [MayIntro1]*: One look at you tells me a lot of things about you. You have the fiery determination and passion expected from prodigious trainers, and I can feel that power emanating from you. Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Pokémon trainer, May?
     OR [MayIntro1]*: Staring at your eyes, I can see unbridled willpower and perseverance, yet also caring and compassion. The perfect traits for a Pokémon trainer. Well, are you indeed a Pokémon trainer, May? 
May [MayIntro1_resp]*: I am a Pokémon trainer, Cynthia! Me and my Blaziken are unstoppable together!

MAY STRIPPING BAG (accessory):
Cynthia [MayIntro2]*: Fire/Fighting types seem to be the most popular combination choice for starter Pokémon. Anyhow, how many badges have you obtained, May?
     OR [MayIntro2]*: Choosing a Fire/Fighting type as your starter seems to have a bit of an advantage, and I wonder if you've been expanding your gym badges collection, May.
May [MayIntro2_resp]*: I have all eight of the Hoenn gym badges. I was the first to take down Steven too! I'd rather travel around Hoenn as a Contest participant than manage the Pokémon League though.
 OR [MayIntro2_resp]*: I have all eight of Hoenn's badges, and I've taken down Steven! I'd much rather perform in Pokémon Contest than sit atop the Pokémon League, though.

MAY STRIPPED BAG (accessory):
Cynthia [MayIntro3]*: You... became the Hoenn League Champion..? And... turned down the title?
     OR [MayIntro3]*: ... You gave up the opportunity to become the Champion of Hoenn?
May [MayIntro3_resp]*: To be honest, I don't think I'm cut out to manage the Pokémon League. I found something I love more.


MAY MUST STRIP SHOES:
Cynthia [MayLeague1]*: I'm curious about the ramifications of you just declining to be the Hoenn League Champion, May. I would expect that some section of the fandom was none too pleased with your abrupt decision.
     OR [MayLeague1]*: I hope you don't mind me prodding, but what was the initial reaction when you let it be known that you wouldn't take up the mantle to become the Hoenn League Champion? Not too receptive, I would suspect.
May [MayLeague1_resp]*: I have to admit that I was a little worried how everyone would react, but they were really nice about it. Just surprised, I guess!

MAY STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
Cynthia [MayLeague2]*: I haven't been keeping up with the latest goings of the Hoenn League. Does this mean that Steven retained his status as Champion? I don't know what the protocol would be in your case.
     OR [MayLeague2]*: I believe what you did is unprecendented as far as the Pokémon Leagues go, and the protocol for such a scenario escapes my mind. Is Steven still the Hoenn League champion?
May [MayLeague2_resp]*: Yep!

MAY STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
Cynthia [MayLeague3]*: This reminds me: I don't think I've ever battled the Hoenn League Champion since the World Tournament. Requesting an exhibition match against Steven would be high in my to-do list.
     OR [MayLeague3]*: If Steven is still currently the Hoenn League Champion, then challenging him to an exhibition match should be a priority of mine. I do hope he wouldn't mind.
May [MayLeague3_resp]*: And that's actually the reason why <i>Wallace</i> is now the champion instead of Steven!


MAY MUST STRIP BRACELET:
Cynthia [MayCoordinator1]*: How goes your career as a Coordinator, May? I would presume that transitioning from a Trainer to Coordinator is not a simple undertaking.
     OR [MayCoordinator1]*: I'm curious as to how you've been doing as a Coordinator recently, May. Sure, there's plenty of difficulties along the way, but that's just normal in competitions.
May [MayCoordinator1_resp]*: There's actually a lot of overlap between training and coordinating, so it's not so bad. And I'm a better at being a Coordinator than I am at playing poker!

MAY STRIPPING BRACELET (accessory):
Cynthia [MayCoordinator2]*: Hmm, I suppose you've got a point. Still, there's a lot of considerations to take when switching between disciplines. That must have taken some time to fully sort out.
     OR [MayCoordinator2]*: There is indeed a significant overlap, but the differences cannot be cast aside. I'm curious what adjustments you had to make during that transition.
May [MayCoordinator2_resp]*: Haha, well... you know I always loved the cutest Pokémon anyway, right? But now I spend so much longer deciding what <i>I'll</i> wear!

MAY STRIPPED BRACELET (accessory):
Cynthia [MayCoordinator3]*: Indeed! I can't deny that I've been tempted from time to time to dress up for my battles. It's wonderful that you can do so as part of the competition.
     OR [MayCoordinator3]*: I know that it would have no bearing in the results of my battles, but I would love to dress up at some battle in the future.
May [MayCoordinator3_resp]*: Oh yeah! I go all out! And my Pokémon love it too!


MAY MUST STRIP BANDANA:
Cynthia [MayTeach1]*: You know, if we ever got the time, you should teach me the tricks of being a coordinator, May. One of my friends keeps telling me that I could stand to win my battles with a touch more elegance.
     OR [MayTeach1]*: I have no doubts that your battles were a formidable combination of strength and style, and you ought to teach me your technique, May. My team has all the power, but none of the elegance or form.
May [MayTeach1_resp]*: Hmmm, it's hard to teach elegance. Some of us are just gifted naturally. But if you practice again and again, eventually you'll know your moves so well that you'll have no hesitation.

MAY STRIPPING BANDANA (accessory):
Cynthia [MayTeach2]*: I see the point you're trying to make, but practice only makes perfect if the practice itself is done correctly. Tell you what, if we can find the time, I should come and watch you train your Pokémon. I might pick up a technique or two.
     OR [MayTeach2]*: It wouldn't hurt to make tweaks to my training strategy if it means my Pokémon will be a touch more elegant. If you'd allow me, I would like to watch one of your training sessions, so that I may observe the difference in our training methods.
May [MayTeach2_resp]*: Me? Teach the famous Cynthia? I'd... I'd be honored. I can't guarantee you'll learn anything you don't already know, but I can give you all the behind-the-scenes coordinator news!

MAY STRIPPED BANDANA (accessory):
Cynthia [MayTeach3]*: Even if I don't get the answers I seek, watching your team show the perfect harmony of power and style is worth the time. Additionally, with you being an expert in both battling and coordinating, I have quite a few questions I would ask of you, if you don't mind.
     OR [MayTeach3]*: My knowledge in Pokémon contests is quite limited, and I have no doubt that you know something that I don't, even if you're unaware of it. I wouldn't mind learning more about contests in general, as a contrast to the battling scene.
May [MayTeach3_resp]*: That sounds great. I think it'd be so cool if we could both try to learn from each other.


MAY MUST STRIP SHORTS:
Cynthia [MayCompetition1]*: Seeing as I've never been one to dabble in coordinating, I wonder how much the culture between coordinating and battling differs. Do you find one more competitive than the other? Perhaps even more toxic?
     OR [MayCompetition1]*: Since you've been entrenched in both the competitive battling and coordinating scene, I was hoping you can provide me some insights as to the difference between the two. Especially when it comes to the culture and atmosphere.
May [MayCompetition1_resp]*: Haha, are you asking if we get just as many hotheads in contests as we do in battles, Cynthia?

MAY STRIPPING SHORTS (major):
Cynthia [MayCompetition2]*: Oh, you know those type of trainers! Aside from them, there are those trainers that are simply unpleasant to be around and is just confrontational in general. Would you say they're as prevalent in the coordinating scene?
May [MayCompetition2_resp]*: It's probably worse, actually! There are so many beautiful people with beautiful Pokémon -- and they won't ever let you forget it! Hold on a sec. I'm supposed to show you what's under my ~clothing~.

MAY STRIPPED SHORTS (major):
Cynthia [MayCompetition3]*: I can see why now. Beauty is such a subjective metric, so arguments are bound to happen. On the contrary, a battle can silence any arguments regarding strength and technique.
     OR [MayCompetition3]*: I'm presuming that it stems from the fact that there's no one-size-fits-all measurement for a Pokémon's beauty, at least not the same barometer that a battle can provide.
May [MayCompetition3_resp]*: It's kind of nice knowing that everyone has their own fans supporting them as number one! Even though my Pokémon are obviously the cutest, hehe!


MAY MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Cynthia [MayPrivate1]*: I'm sure being a coordinator is fun and all, but surely you enjoy some time away from the spotlight. After all, having a little bit of private time wouldn't hurt. How do you spend those moments?
     OR [MayPrivate1]*: I have no doubts that you have a lot of passion for your job as a coordinator, but having some time for yourself every now and then must be very relieving. What do you usually do in your spare time?
May [MayPrivate1_resp]*: It depends on how long I have. I've met so many people and Pokémon on my travels, and I love to catch up with them when I can! Oh... it's my turn?

MAY STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Cynthia [MayPrivate2]*: Oh, I know exactly that feeling! I've traveled into many regions and met so many interesting people, but it wouldn't be feasible for me to visit all of them again, given my limited free time.
     OR [MayPrivate2]*: I'm in the same boat as you, but I haven't have had as much free time as I did when I was your age. Such a shame too, since I've met a lot of people during my travels whom I would love to visit again.
May [MayPrivate2_resp]*: It's so hard, right? Sometimes I call my friends at a video phone just to see how they're going. But I'm sure glad nobody's invented a portable video phone, because I don't want them to see how I'm going right now, haha!

MAY STRIPPED SHIRT (major)
Cynthia [MayPrivate3]*: I've heard that some far away regions have managed to develop portable video phones. I do hope they make it to Sinnoh some time soon. That would make it much easier to make contact with my friends.
May [MayPrivate3_resp]*: That's terrible! If I could talk to my friends whenever I wanted, I don't think I'd get <i>any</i> work done!


MAY MUST STRIP BRA:
Cynthia [MayFriend1]*: This is a bit of an odd question, but have you done this in front of a male friend before? Or a female friend perhaps? You do understand where I'm going with this question?
     OR [MayFriend1]*: I hope you're not put off with what I'm going to ask, but have you done something like this with a friend before, either male or female? Not in a strip poker context, but I'm guessing you know what I meant.
May [MayFriend1_resp]*: Ah, t-that's... I don't have to answer that, do I? But no. Not really. Not like that.

MAY STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Cynthia [MayFriend2]*: I know it was a question that came from absolutely nowhere. I was just thinking that this would be as good as a place as any to practice some intimate stripping, given that it would be overshadowed later on anyway.
     OR [MayFriend2]*: This would be a good place to do a dry run for such a scenario, given that everyone's bound to do it at some point. At the very least, this is a good way of removing inhibitions regarding nudity.
May [MayFriend2_resp]*: Yeah, this is a dry run. Well, not <i>that</i> dry anymore. Forget I said that! I'm just nervous, okay?

MAY STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Cynthia [MayFriend3]*: Hmm, what's that? I must be hearing things, but I thought you said something about wetting yourself? I hope not. The last thing we need now is someone losing their bladder control.
     OR [MayFriend3]*: I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that. I know the going is getting tough, but it's not bad enough for you to become incontinent all of a sudden... That's what you said, right?
May [MayFriend3_resp]*: Eh?! No! That's not what I meant, Cynthia! I just meant I was getting excited. Y'know... <i>downstairs</i>... Geez, I'm just trying to show you my boobs. Trust me, everything else is TMI!


MAY MUST STRIP SPATS:
Cynthia [MayUnderwear1]*: It was about time your ~clothing~ came off, May. I must admit that the way it was hugging your body was very intriguing... f-from a fashion standpoint that is... It's difficult to find clothes that fit perfectly like your ~clothing~ did for my size...
     OR [MayUnderwear1]*: You know, I've been thinking about your ~clothing~ for quite a while now... I mean due to the fact that it fits you perfectly, of course! When you're my height, fitting clothes can be difficult to find...
May [MayUnderwear1_resp]*: Yeah, sorry! These really don't leave anything to the imagination, do they? And if you don't get a pair in your size, they'll split the first time you bend over. 

MAY STRIPPING SPATS (revealing crotch):
Cynthia [MayUnderwear2]*: Oh, you don't have to apologize! I don't mind taking in the view... I mean, it's certainly not distracting me from anything! And it wouldn't hurt to admire your... choice in underwear...
     OR [MayUnderwear2]*: It certainly doesn't, not that I would want it any other way... Well, since you're conscious about your fashion sense, I thought the least I can do is... appreciate it...?
May [MayUnderwear2_resp]*: I hope you got a good enough look, because off they come! I haven't done this before, so don't make fun of me, okay?

MAY STRIPPED SPATS (revealed crotch):
Cynthia [MayUnderwear3]*: Shaved, eh? Is it for hygienic purposes, or did you have other things in mind when you decided to shave?
     OR [MayUnderwear3]*: Quite smooth and well shaven... Are there other factors aside from hygiene that led to your decision to shave?
May [MayUnderwear3_resp]*: It just feels better to be smooth against my spats, haha! No deep or meaningful reason.


MAY MUST STRIP BIKINI BOTTOMS SUNSET SECRET:
Cynthia [MaySummerAlt1]*: That's some fancy-looking swimsuit, and it probably didn't come cheap either. It's exectly the perfect underwear to attract attention in a game like this, don't you agree?
May [MaySummerAlt1_resp]*: That's what I was hoping for, Cynthia! But now the attention is for all the wrong reasons.

MAY STRIPPING BIKINI BOTTOMS (revealing crotch) SUNSET SECRET:
Cynthia [MaySummerAlt2]*: If you want me to look away, May, just say the word. I'm certain that fear and embarassment would curtail your arousal for the moment.
May [MaySummerAlt2_resp]*: I'm not scared! To be honest, I always wondered what kind of attention I'd get at a nudist beach... Not that I thought I'd ever get close to finding out.

MAY STRIPPED BIKINI BOTTOMS (revealed crotch) SUNSET SECRET:
Cynthia [MaySummerAlt3]*: Looking at it now, I'm sure you'd get plenty of attention, since you've certainly grabbed mine... Not in a lustful way, of course... It's just... out of curiosity...
     OR [MaySummerAlt3]*: I've never been to a nudist beach either, but I would like to think you can capture my attention... I mean, in a inquisitive manner... not out of desire or anything...
May [MaySummerAlt3_resp]*: I kinda hoped to get <i>someone</i> excited, but this is not exactly how I thought it would go.

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.

If May to left and Cynthia to right:

CYNTHIA MUST STRIP COAT:
May [mayCyn1]*: You know, I never expected to see a Pokémon champion here! What made you decide to come to a game like this, ~name~?
Cynthia [MayDecision1]*: Well, I wanted to do something different, and to challenge myself. I haven't played strip poker, you see. All I can say is that it's very different from Pokémon battles, May.
     OR [MayDecision1]*: Do you know how quickly things can turn into a routine if you do it all the time, May? Well, I figured that breaking my routine would be a good idea, and here I am.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING COAT (minor):
May [mayCyn1s]*: I guess that makes sense... Is there a reason you chose strip poker over something else though?
 OR [mayCyn1s]*: I see... although strip poker wouldn't be my first choice. Is there a reason you chose this in particular?
Cynthia [MayDecision2]*: ... Well... you see... Nudity is not really something I encounter in my routine and I was curious to see a bit of it... <i>I mean as a subject of study, of course</i>... 
     OR [MayDecision2]*: ... I figured that this might feel a little bit more intimate than my usual activities... I mean <i>intimidating</i>, not <i>intimate</i>...

CYNTHIA STRIPPED COAT (minor):
May [mayCyn1stripped]*: "Subject of study" you say. Well, I guess I can't blame you, we all need to focus our thoughts elsewhere sometimes.May. Also, this line clearly only responds to one of the two above alternatives. We can sort this out later.
Cynthia [MayDecision3]*: Indeed... All work and no play can lead to mental breakdowns. Mental health is always important.
     OR [MayDecision3]*: If you allow yourself to fall into an endless routine, things can get dour very quickly. That's why you have to mix things up from time to time.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SCARF:
May [mayCyn2]*: You wouldn't mind if I got your autograph later, would you, Cynthia? Max will be so jealous!
Cynthia [MayAutograph1]*: A quick autograph wouldn't hurt at all. What exactly do you want me to autograph, May?
     OR [MayAutograph1]*: I've never been one to turn down an autograph for a fan. I'll autograph whatever you would like me to, May.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SCARF (accessory):
May [mayCyn2s]*: Um... how about autographing your scarf? You lost it fair and square, after all!
Cynthia [MayAutograph2]*: Well, I have plenty of scarves, so I can afford to give you one. But, you have to give me one of your items in return. Fair is fair, after all!
     OR [MayAutograph2]*: I wouldn't mind giving you one of my scarves, but under that logic, wouldn't that mean that I would receive one of your items in return?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED SCARF (accessory):
May [mayCyn2stripped] (if undefeated so far)*: Haha! Sure, it's a deal! But you'll have to make me lose a round first!
 OR [mayCyn2stripped]*: Haha! Sure, it's a deal!
Cynthia [MayAutograph3]*: It would most likely clash with my outfit, but I could afford to mix things up every now and then.
     OR [MayAutograph3]*: If there's ever a time and place to get explorative with clothing, I suppose this would be the opportunity to do so.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SHOES:
May [mayCyn3]*: Ever played anything with stakes this high, Cynthia? For fun, I mean.
Cynthia [MayStakes1]*: Don't tell anyone about this... but when I was your age, I once played a game of strip Pokémon battle. Everytime one of your Pokémon faints, you remove a piece of clothing. I didn't have to strip anything in that game.
     OR [MayStakes1]*: I've never told this story before, but I've played something like this before, but as a Pokémon battle. I ended up not removing anything, since none of my Pokémon fainted during that battle. Of course, the same can't be said of my opponent.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
May [mayCyn3s]*: Whoa, a strip <i>Pokémon battle!?</i> That's so daring, Cynthia! Who was your opponent?
Cynthia [MayStakes2]*: It was against Arcade Star Dahlia, the Frontier Brain of the Battle Arcade. She said she wanted a different type of gamble, and somehow came to the conclusion that a strip Pokémon battle would be a good idea.

CYTHANIA STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
May [mayCyn3stripped]*: Isn't Dahlia that stylish lady? I bet she didn't take losing too well! You didn't make her strip in front of an audience, did you?!
Cynthia [MayStakes3]*: Not at all! We fought in her private quarters, so we had a lot of privacy. She was rather graceful in her defeat, and even wanted me to stay for longer, but I had to move on to the next battle.
     OR [MayStakes3]*: She insisted that we battle in her room, so we had no one watching us. She was rather glad that I got her naked, but was extremely disappointed when I told her I couldn't stick around for long.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
May [mayCyn4]*: The Cynthia I know from TV is always graceful in defeat. Not that it's always defeat, haha!
Cynthia [MayGrace1]*: Now, don't celebrate just yet. I may have lost this round, but I still have a long way to go, and I'm not letting up. It will take more than this to shake my concentration.
     OR [MayGrace1]*: Things might be heating up in my end, but I'm not melting down any time soon. I'm just about done warming up for this game.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
May [mayCyn4s]*: Yeah, don't give up! A close battle is more exciting for everyone anyway, especially if you're showing a side of yourself your fans don't normally get to see.
Cynthia [MayGrace2]*: Speaking of exciting... You're not getting <i>too</i> excited about this, are you? Not that I mind, but I was just curious...
	OR [MayGrace2]*: Indeed, an intense battle can really excite you, but not quite the same way this game might. Would you say that's the case for you?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
May [mayCyn4stripped]*: Just because you're giving away all <i>your</i> secrets doesn't mean I have to give away all of mine, Cynthia. But every part of this game makes my heart race.
Cynthia [MayGrace3]*: Regardless of your reasons, I'm glad you're enjoying this game, one way or the other.
	OR [MayGrace3]*: Either way, it's not a secret that this game is living up to your expectation, or exceeded it even. 


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTS AND MAY NOT NUDE:
May [mayCyn5]*: I hope you're into trying new things, Cynthia, 'cause we have a little request.
Cynthia [MayRequest1]*: Hmm, and what would your request be, May? A little twist to this game perhaps?
     OR [MayRequest1]*: I'm not really sure what to expect from your request, May, but I accept your challenge!.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTS (major) AND MAY NOT NUDE:
May [mayCyn5s]*: Haha, I was just going to say take off your pants, but if you want a twist... If you lose the next hand, I dare you to kiss... hmmmm... ~player~? If ~player.ifMale(he's|she's)~ okay with that. One short peck on the lips. And you can dare me to do something if I lose instead!
Cynthia [MayRequest2]*: I don't think putting ~player~ on the spot like that is particularly nice... Although, if you want to remain in the direction, perhaps I can instead kiss... you?
     OR [MayRequest2]*: Hmm, perhaps if we had talked about it before the game started. Pulling in ~player~ all of a sudden is not the right thing to do... Since you came up with the idea, it might be better if you were the recipient instead.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTS (major) AND MAY NOT NUDE:
May [mayCyn5stripped]*: Kiss m-me? Um... okay. Only if you lose the next hand, remember. And what should I do if <i>I'm</i> the one that loses?
Cynthia [MayRequest3]*: Good question. I'm sure you'd like to know, but this bet would be more thrilling if I don't tell you what the punishment is until you actually lose. It's one of those things that you'd rather not know ahead of time.
     OR [MayRequest3]*: Well, well, don't you think it would be more exciting if I don't tell you what your punishment would be? I'll raise the stakes up a bit, so you better hope you don't lose.


CYNTHIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTS (major) AND BET MADE:
May has a good hand  [mayCyn5good]*: Get those kissing lips ready! It's time to find out how badly you did.
        an okay hand [mayCyn5okay]*: I've got even more than usual riding on this one, but I can achieve my dreams if I'm determined enough!
        a bad hand   [mayCyn5bad]*: Uh oh. At least Cynthia is a nice, kind, merciful person who would never hurt me, right? Like, I'm not going to get spanked if I lose, am I?
          
     Against May with a good hand
Cynthia has a good hand  []*: Not so fast, May! My hand is nothing to scoff at. The odds might not be entirely in your favor.
            an okay hand []*: Either I'm on the back foot, or you're simply bluffing, May. Either way, we shall find out soon enough.
            a bad hand   []*: Well... I did come here to try out new experiences, and kissing you is hardly a bad punishment, if it can even be considered as one.     

     Against May with an okay hand
Cynthia has a good hand  []*: It will take all the determination you have to get yourself out of this predicament, May. Rather than being discouraged, now is the time to show your resolve.
            an okay hand []*: When I participate in competitions, I give everything I have. I never go for half measures. 
            a bad hand   []*: I might be down, but I wouldn't discount myself. It will take more than a downturn of luck to weaken my resolve.     

     Against May with a bad hand
Cynthia has a good hand  []*: It's nothing too severe, really. You will find out soon enough what I have in store for you, and you might agree that it's a creative punishment, May.
            an okay hand []*: Well, I never thought about the possibility of spanking you, neither would I have went with that even if I did. The pain of not knowing your punishment will hurt more than your actual punishment. 
            a bad hand   []*: It seems this might go either way... or perhaps it might go a different direction entirely, May. I got too overeager about our bet, and I clearly made the wrong decision for my card exchange. 


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTYHOSE IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET (A KISS):
May [mayCyn6bet]*: You lost! Time to pay up, Cynthia! You can give me a peck on the cheek now!
Moon [moon_may_cynthia_tongue]: What?! That's totally lame. We were promised tongue, May! How can you just Wimpod out like that?
Cynthia [MayBetLost1]*: I thought it was supposed to be a peck on the lips, hmm? Did you change your mind about that? Anyhow, I wouldn't mind kissing your cheek instead.
     OR [MayBetLost1]*: A just reward for a well-placed bet... but I thought I was supposed to kiss you on the lips when I lose? If you're not comfortable with that, I suppose kissing you on the cheek instead would be a good compromise.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTYHOSE (minor) IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET (A KISS):
May [mayCyn6bets]*: Ahaha, yeah... it was meant to be a kiss on the lips, wasn't it? Okay! I won't back down! If you're okay with kissing another girl, that is...
Moon [moon_may_cynthia_kiss_turns_heads]: That's more like it. Nothing turns heads like a girl-on-girl kiss, right?
Cynthia [MayBetLost2]*: Well, trying out something different is the reason I came here for in the first place... Give me a moment to remove this thing, and I'll give you a quick peck...
     OR [MayBetLost2]*: On one hand, this is unexplored territory for me. On the other hand, that was my intention when joining this game. Once I've gotten this thing off, I'll kiss you as promised.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (minor) IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET (A KISS):
May [mayCyn6betstripped]*: ~silent~
Cynthia [MayBetLost3]*: ~silent~
Moon [moon_may_cynthia_kiss_nice]: Hah, nice!

CYNTHIA HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (minor) IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET (A KISS):
May [mayCyn6betaftermath]*: Um, okay. Wow. So many questions. Can we do that again? I mean, if you want to. Forget I said that. Sorry! I just didn't expect to feel so confused right now!
When can we do that again? 
Cynthia [MayBetLostAfter1]*: Oh, I can see that you've enjoyed it a lot, May. I must say that my feeling about this is a bit confusing... I think it would do us good to settle down for a bit...
     OR [MayBetLostAfter1]*: Well, yous ure got excited after that, May, and I must say that I'm feeling a bit of excitement along with confusion... Let's calm don a bit, and hopefully our minds would be cleared...


MAY MUST STRIP SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET:
May [MayCynBetWin1]*: Ah! <i>*gulp*</i> So w-What did you have planned for me, Cynthia? It's not painful, is it?
Cynthia [MayBetWin1]*: Nothing too crazy, really. I just want you to tell everyone what your deepest, darkest sexual fantasy is. And don't hold back on the juicy details.
     OR [MayBetWin1]*: It took me quite a while to think of this, but here it goes: I dare you to tell us your most carnal fantasy. A lustful desire that you have been keeping secret. Be liberal in giving a detailed description.

MAY STRIPPING SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET:
May [MayCynBetWin2]*: Like, you want me to say it in front of <i>everyone</i>?! With details? That... that might be a bit much. But... um... what if I only tell you if I have to do the forfeit? I think it'd be easier to do in that headspace, y'know?
Cynthia [MayBetWin2]*: Ah, saying out loud what you're fantasizing in the moment... That's even more tittilating than I initially envisioned! But... if you don't do the forfeit, you'll have to tell it while the remaining players are forfeiting. Fair is fair, after all.
     OR [MayBetWin2]*: I was actually thinking that you'll just tell us what your secret kink is, but if you want to narrate your forfeit-induced fantasy for everyone to hear, then that's even better. Of course, if you do win, you'll have to narrate it still, for the benefit of those still performing their forfeit.

MAY STRIPPED SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET:
May [MayCynBetWin3]*: Ah! What have I gotten myself in for?! But... but... I'll do it!
Cynthia [MayBetWin3]*: My, now isn't this quite the excitement? Just to hear the unfiltered sexual desires of another woman while in the throes of ecstasy... It would be quite an unbelievable experience!
     OR [MayBetWin3]*: I know that people your age can be quite... imaginative when it comes to sexual fantasies, so getting to hear yours while your hormones are all the way up... These has all the makings of an exhilirating memory!


ANYONE ELSE MUST STRIP IMMEDIATELY AFTER BET:
May [MayCynBetNull1]*: Haha, looks like we both made it out without having to pay up! Lucky!
Cynthia [MayBetNull1]*: You should thank Arceus that you didn't lose, May. I had a very exciting dare in mind for you. It's such a shame that the idea would go to waste.
     OR [MayBetNull1]*: For a second there, I was worried I would lose. I wouldn't have minded at all if I were to kiss you, but you might not be as receptive for the dare I had in store for you, May.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTS AND MAY NUDE: (no bet)
May [mayCyn5alt]*: How much do you think you weigh nude, Cynthia I'm definitely not compiling a national database of Pokémon trainer stats for a professor or anything!
Cynthia [MayWeight1]*: I think I'm about 140 pounds, May... That was a bit out of the blue. Why did you ask?
     OR [MayWeight1]*: I haven't checked in a while, but I'm right around 140 pounds. There must be a reason you would ask such an unusual question, May.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTS (major) AND MAY NUDE:
May [mayCyn5alts]*: You're so tall and slim, so maybe I was just curious. 140 pounds, was it? I'll have to remember that.
Cynthia [MayWeight2]*: ... You didn't quite answer my question, and I'm beginning to think that you're thinking exactly what I think you're thinking.
     OR [MayWeight2]*: Considering that you seem to be deep in thought, and you did a rather fine job dodging my question, I can presume that you're thinking <i>that</i> about me...


CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTS (major) AND MAY NUDE:
May [mayCyn5altstripped]*: A lady doesn't strip and tell!
Cynthia [MayWeight3]*: Hmm, what could be going on in that head of yours. I guess it will go down as an unsolved mystery...
     OR [MayWeight3]*: There's not that many things you could be thinking of right now, is there? Not a particularly difficult inference to make at this time...


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTYHOSE:
May [mayCyn6]*: Those pantyhose are a sexy look on you, Cynthia. Got any tips for a technically-adult girl who wants to look more womanly?
Cynthia [MayWomanly1]*: The proper hairstyle and attire can make a lot of difference in altering your perceived age, May. I think getting rid of your side bangs could help you look more mature.
     OR [MayWomanly1]*: If you want to look more mature, May, then something has to change about your appearance. Outfits are easy enough to change, but I think a change of hairstyle is also in order, especially in regards with your side bangs.

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTYHOSE (minor):
May [mayCyn6s]*: What made you think I meant me? I'm breaking hearts and taking names. Haha... But seriously, you are <i>stunning</i>. You must be turning down dates left and right.
Cynthia [MayWomanly2]*: I appreciate the compliment, but my love life isn't as colorful as you're envisioning. Busy work schedule and all that entails conspired to make it difficult for me.
     OR [MayWomanly2]*: You flatter me, but you know how difficult it is to be both a League Champion and an archaeologist. All the work and overtime and travels, it's not really practical to have a love life during all of that.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (minor):
May [mayCyn6stripped]*: Aw, that's too bad. You can't fit it in, and here I am wide open just waiting for anyone to fit in! Haha... oh well. Life's not fair for either of us.
Cynthia [MayWomanly3]*: ... Right... At least you have a clear idea of what you're looking for. I'm beginning to understand why you looked so eager to play this game.
     OR [MayWomanly3]*: It seems that we're looking for the same thing, generally speaking. Although, in your case, you're more likely to gain your want than I would.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP BRA:
May [mayCyn7]*: Anyone else feel like this is a special moment? Like you're about to see a Legendary Pokémon or something?
Cynthia [MayLegendary1]*: You really feel so, May? You might be expecting too much of my breasts. They're not particularly big or noteworthy... I suppose, like a Legendary Pokémon, people haven't seem them before...
    OR [MayLegendary1]*: I'm not sure this would be considered a momentous occasion like meeting a Legendary Pokémon, May... Expanding on that analogy, most people will probably never see this in their lives...

CYNTHIA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
May [mayCyn7s]*: I don't know, it just feels really special, you know? And the trainer in me tells me I should be holding two Pokéballs right now.
Cynthia [MayLegendary2]*: When you put it like that, I must admit that I'm feeling conflicted about this. It's almost like I'm somewhat... excited to be catching your full attention.
     OR [MayLegendary2]*: In an odd way, this does sort of feels special... I don't know what to think of this, but I can feel myself feeling flattered with the way you're looking at me anticipatingly.

CYNTHIA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
May [mayCyn7stripped]*: They're... they're perfect. Not that I expected anything less.
Cynthia [MayLegendary3]*: I appreciate the compliment, May. Coming from someone like you, it does make my heart flutter in a way I wouldn't have expected.
     OR [MayLegendary3]*: The more this game goes on, the more I begin to appreciate this attention you've been giving me, May. I wouldn't mind getting obsessed with the feeling.


CYNTHIA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
May [mayCyn8]*: Go for it, Cynthia! You always shine the brightest, so dazzle us! Sorry, no offense to you-know-who, but we all know it's true!
Cynthia [MayInterest1]*: You always know what to say to make me blush, May. I can sense a rather strong desire coming from your direction. Could it be...?
     OR [MayInterest1]*: If you compliment me any more, my knees might just buckle, May. I wouldn't suppose you were thinking exactly in that direction...

CYNTHIA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
May [mayCyn8s]*: Any guy would give you full points for an appealing move like this. Any girl too, if my score is anything to go by. But I might be a little bit biased...
Cynthia [MayInterest2]*: Hmm, you seem a bit eager to see me nude. Of course, such a reaction is to be expected, but you seem even more invested than usual. Got anything to say about that?
     OR [MayInterest2]*: Between all the compliments and now, your most recent comment, I have a feeling that your interest in my losses extends to more than just a competitive standpoint. Do you have something that you want to tell me personally?

CYNTHIA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
May [mayCyn8stripped]*: I hope you don't just think I'm saying this to make you feel better. But, uh, I'm... I think I'm kind of into you, Cynthia. My heart won't stop racing, and it won't tell me why.
Cynthia [MayInterest3]*: Oh my! I had my suspicions, but for you to admit it outright..! How about we hang out after this game is over, and see where this might take us?
     OR [MayInterest3]*: I had figured as much, and I must admit that my heart skipped a beat hearing you say it... I wouldn't mind exploring this... potential relationship even further.


MAY MUST FORFEIT AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET:
"Tell everyone what your deepest, darkest sexual fantasy is. A lustful desire that you have been keeping secret. And don't hold back on the juicy details."
May [MayCyn9forfeitA]*: Ah! That's me out... Uh, so about that bet, Cynthia...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeitStart]*: Well, well, well. Even an innocent-looking woman like you must have a couple of salacious thoughts you've hidden in the darkest recesses of your mind, May... Better to let them out now more than ever.
     OR [MayBetForfeitStart]*: With all that's happened to~background.time~, you must have had one or two lustful desires that's been brewing in your head, May. I'm good at keeping secrets, so don't be reluctant in sharing every excruciating detail of your most carnal desires.

MAY STARTING FORFEIT AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET:
May [MayCyn9forfeitB]*: A deal's a deal... Let's just keep this between us here though, okay? I don't want any of my rivals to hear what I'm about to say.
Cynthia [MayBetForfeitContinued]*: My lips are completely sealed. Nobody would know your secret fantasies. Not your rivals, not Wallace, and not even your own Pokémon.
     OR [MayBetForfeitContinued]*: This can be a little secret between us women. Whatever happens in the Inventory stays in the Inventory.

MAY FORFEITING AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET:
May [MayCyn9forfeitC]*: So, um, I have this fantasy that I'm battling another trainer in the woods. I know I'll win, so I bet everything I have. But when I lose, what ~player.ifMale(the trainer|she)~ asks for is my first time...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit01]*: Not at all different it seems from this little bet of ours. You seem to have a habit of doing these high-risk bets. Oh, look at me ramble! Don't let me take you out of your mindspace, May.

May [MayCyn9forfeitD]*: In my fantasy, the other trainer is ~player.ifMale(really cute|a sexy blonde lady)~, and I'm still panting and horny from losing. Um, sometimes I get horny when I lose. Sorry if that's TMI.
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit02]*: Well, this loss has undoubtedly got you all hot and bothered. On a more serious note, I can see how this could present some issues... but also some advantages...

May [MayCyn9forfeitE]*: ~player.ifMale(The other trainer runs a hand|She runs her hands)~ over my spats and can tell how wet I am. S-Sometimes I finger myself to completion just on this part of the fantasy... I... I probably didn't to tell you that part.
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit03]*: I do appreciate that you're opening up and being as detailed as this... I'm good at keeping mental notes, so don't be concerned about overwhelming with details.

May [MayCyn9forfeitF]*: ~player.ifMale(The trainer flips me over and|The blonde lady puts me over her lap)~ and starts spanking my butt through my spats for being a very naughty girl. Um... I should explain. That's only a part of my daydream because I'm into that. I mean, I'd like to try it one day...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit04]*: I must admit this whole scenario is very enticing to me too. Good Arceus, I hope this doesn't awaken anything in me.

May [MayCyn9forfeitG]*: I'm still thinking about the part of my secret fantasy where I'm getting spanked by the trainer I lost to. The next part is... my spats are down and I'm getting spanked on my bare butt.<br><i>Ahhh!</i><br>S-Sorry! That moan just kinda squeaked out...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit05]*: Well, I'm sure being spanked like that must be a mixture of humiliation... and pleasure. Although, I think I'd prefer not being the one getting humiliated in that scenario.

May [MayCyn9forfeitH]*: Next, my legs are spread wide open... I like to imagine the ~player.ifMale(other|blonde)~ trainer is playing with me down here. I pretend that my fingers are ~player.ifMale(doing what the trainer's fingers would be doing|her fingers)~...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit06]*: My, this fantasy of yours is even more intriguing than I even expected, May! Suddenly, all my fantasies and desires seem sterile in comparison. Yours is enough to make me sweat...

May [MayCyn9forfeitI]*: In my fantasy, the trainer has a long~player.ifMale(...|)~ tongue. Not like a Lickitung! Just long enough to reach deep enough inside me... I normally put two fingers in for this part, but I'm a bit nervous because you're all watching me...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit07]*: Well, that's the consequence of losing the bet that you started, May. I must say, this story of yours is very intriguing indeed, like reading a well-preserved manuscript... or a well-written smut.

May [MayCyn9forfeitJ]*: I've never, y'know, <i>done it</i> before. So by this point in my plan... uh, I mean <i>"fantasy"!</i> At this point in my fantasy, I'm expecting the trainer to take ~player.ifMale(the|her)~ prize, right? But ~player.ifMale(the trainer|she)~ just keeps me wanting more...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit08]*: My, you're still a virgin? I thought you'd be the more experienced one between the two of us... I mean, given your confidence and all...

May [MayCyn9forfeitK]*: I'm here, just aching for the full experience, but ~player.ifMale(the trainer I'm dreaming about|she)~ just makes me climax again and again until my arm gets tired or I fall asleep... ~player.ifMale(It's kinda rude to ask for a partner to go deeper, right?|I want to try reciprocating, but how does a woman even ask another woman about that, right?)~
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit09]*: ... I'm a bit ashamed to say this, but the mental image of you being stuck in that ordeal... (Oh may Arceus forgive me for my mental sins...)

May [MayCyn9forfeitL]*: I don't know why I can't get properly laid even in my own fantasy... I hope I'm not a virgin forever...
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit10]*: If it's any consolation for you, I'm in the same island as you, May. I hope you find this ~player.ifMale(other trainer|blonde lady)~ that would help you with your... special experience...

May [MayCyn9forfeitM]*: Um, so that's the whole thing. I kinda wanna be mad that I had to tell you everything, Cynthia. But to be honest, I think it helped. I'm... I'm getting really close now.
Cynthia [MayBetForfeit11]*: My, my, if you close your eyes and imagine that the ~player.ifMale(other trainer|blonde lady)~ arrived to help you finish... Oh, that's such a tempting thought... b-by that, I mean... tempting to fantasize about, right?


MAY HEAVY FORFEITING AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET: (same case, play once, no sequence)
May [MayCyn9heavyforfeitA]*: <i>Let me give you an even better reward for winning. It can be anything you want. There's no one else in this forest, after all...</i>
Cynthia [MayBetHeavyForfeitA]*: Ahh, the seclusion of the forest. It does make you feel a wee bit adventurous... n-not that I would know anything about that...

May [MayCyn9heavyforfeitB]*: <i>S-Spank me harder, ~player.ifMale(please|ma'am)!</i>
Cynthia [MayBetHeavyForfeitB]*: I must say, you have quite a cute butt, May. I-i could see why one might enjoy spanking it... <i>(That's one way of discovering a kink. Should I try exploring this with her?)</i>

May [MayCyn9heavyforfeitC]*: <i>Don't just tease me! Make love to me like you promised...</i>
Cynthia [MayBetHeavyForfeitC]*: <i>(At this point, I can't tell who's teasing who. Do I look evidently flushed right now? Has she figured out that I was turned on by her fantasy?)</i>


MAY FINISHING AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET:
May [MayCyn9forfeitfinishing]*: I'm... I'm there! Yes! Oh gosh, yes! Punish me for losing! I'm a naughty girl!

MAY FINISHED AND LOST CYNTHIA'S BET:
May [MayCyn9forfeitfinished]*: Ah, that felt <i>so</i> good! I think I'll need to go stretch my legs a bit after this.
Cynthia [MayBetForfeitFinished]*: Speaking of stretching legs, we should... have a Pokémon battle after this, just for the sake of it. I know a secluded place near here where we can go u-undisturbed. Only if you're up for it...


GAME OVER AND CYNTHIA WON GAME (regardless of bet outcome):
May [MayCynDominated]*: Wow, you completely dominated, Cynthia! I'd like a rematch sometime... You pick the game, and I'll pick the stakes.
Cynthia []*: Does it have to be another strip poker game? In order to get to know each other better as Pokémon Trainers, I would like our Pokémon to have a match. Would you care to be my opponent, May?

GAME OVER AND MAY LOST BET AND CYNTHIA AND MAY BOTH LOST GAME:
May [MayCynBothLost]*: Ah! Darn it. I was so sure I was going to win this. I need to get my mind on something else. Cynthia, did you say you know a place nearby that we can have that Pokémon battle? I'd... I'd be up for that.
Cynthia []*: Ah, yes! It's about a 10 minute walk from here, and we can talk while on our way... You wouldn't happen to be willing to have another bet on who would win that battle, would you?

---

MAY MUST STRIP BAG:
May [MayCynTable1]*: I really got lucky being put on a table with such amazing people, didn't I?
Cynthia [MayTable1]*: You've got a bit of a competitive streak, don't you, May? I would presume that you came here to get that rush of competition, but wanted a bit of break from Pokémon competitions, as well.
     OR [MayTable1]*: One look at you tells me that you're not one for giving up a competition this easily. Be it a battle, a contest, or a strip poker game. Regardless, you came here for a change of pace from the usual routine, I would suspect.

MAY STRIPPING BAG (accessory):
May [MayCynTable2]*: Winning isn't everything, but I have to admit that I'm really hoping I can pull off a victory to~background.time~! I'll give it everything I have!
Cynthia [MayTable2]*: Well, when your dignity is at stake, there's no room for error. I hope the pressure of ending up naked in front of everyone doesn't get to you. The last thing you want is to lose your composure.
     OR [MayTable2]*: Being confident about yourself is key in a game like this. If you worry too much about possibly ending up naked, it will start a negative feedback loop and you're more likely to end up naked as a result.

MAY STRIPPED BAG (accessory):
May [MayCynTable3]*: Geez, way to psyche me out, Cynthia! But you won't get me to crumble <i>that</i> easily!
Cynthia [MayTable3]*: We'll have to wait and see about that. Some things are easier said than done, and being thrust into an unfamiliar situation like this is bound to spring up some unexpected reactions.
     OR [MayTable3]*: Saying it is one thing, but putting it into action is another battle entirely. In situations like this, there's no way of really knowing how you'll react once the going gets tough.


MAY MUST STRIP SHOES:
May [MayCynStyle1]*: Don't I get points for style? No? Well, it was worth a try!
Cynthia [MayStyle1]*: Well, I do like your fashion sense. Seeing your outfit made me think that I can afford to be a lot less conservative when it comes to my attire. What do you think?
     OR [MayStyle1]*: I will give you a point for your choice of attire. It's more fitting for a game like this than what I came in with. At the very least, it looks a lot more modern than my outfit.

MAY STRIPPING SHOES (minor):
May [MayCynStyle2]*: We should go shopping together, Cynthia! There's nothing wrong with the classics, but sometimes it feels like you only have one outfit, you know?
Cynthia [MayStyle2]*: Well, I actually have 3 outfits, but I get your point. Speaking of which, I wouldn't mind if you picked out an outfit for me. Fashion is hardly wasted money, considering it can from people's first impression of a person.
     OR [MayStyle2]*: I have 2 other outfits besides this one, but it wouldn't hurt to add a couple more choices. This outfit is nice and all, but it looks out of place in certain scenarios, you know. I wouldn't mind splurging a bit on new clothes.

MAY STRIPPED SHOES (minor):
May [MayCynStyle3]*: I can't wait! I'm going to pick out so many cute things for us! Oh, and we can go swimsuit shopping too! A girl can never have too many swimsuits.
Cynthia [MayStyle3]*: I suppose you're right. I've gotten greedy before and bought a white swimsuit and black swimsuit, but a little bit more color in my wardrobe wouldn't hurt. 
     OR [MayStyle3]*: I do own a pair of black swimsuit and white swimsuit, but a handful more options wouldn't hurt. I wouldn't be a good look if I wore the same two pairs every time.


MAY MUST STRIP BRACELET:
May [MayCynPokemon1]*: I'm glad my Pokémon can't see me right now. It's hard to explain a game like this to them!
Cynthia [MayPokemon1]*: Speaking of which, I don't think you've mentioned what your Pokémon were, May. I'm curious about what your team looks like.
     OR [MayPokemon1]*: Since we're talking about your Pokémon, I was wondering which Pokémon you usually use in contests, May. You must have quite a handy team at your disposal.

MAY STRIPPING BRACELET (accessory):
May [MayCynPokemon2]*: Nothing can come between me and my Blaziken! But don't tell my Beautifly I said that! Or my Glaceon. In fact, don't tell any of them I was playing favorites! I want them to keep getting along.
Cynthia [MayPokemon2]*: I'll keep that in mind when I meet your Pokémon. Given that you have a Blaziken, I presume that you raised it from a Torchic, which was a gift from your father.
     OR [MayPokemon2]*: Whenever I get the chance to visit your hometown, I'll make sure I won't tell your Pokémon. Anyhow, the fact that you have a Blaziken suggests that your father, the professor, gave it to you as a Torchic. Is that right?

MAY STRIPPED BRACELET (accessory):
May [MayCynPokemon3]*: Yeah, I raised up Blaziken from just a little chick. But he's not a little chick anymore! I have to pay for two adults if we want to go to the movies together.
Cynthia [MayPokemon3]*: Sounds like quite the grand Blaziken. No wonder you consider him to be the ace of your team. Such a close bond with your Pokémon takes quite some time to fully develop, but the benefits are immense.
     OR [MayPokemon3]*: I can clearly see why you hold your Blaziken in such high regard. For you to be by its side its entire life, you've develop alevel of trust that's made you inseperable. Such a partnershipp is quite formidable indeed.


MAY MUST STRIP BANDANA:
May [MayCynElegance1]*: What makes me a good Pokémon coordinator is that I know how to lose gracefully. ... Wait, it's me <i>again?!</i> Dammit!
Cynthia [MayElegance1]*: We must present an image of dignity, refinement, and grace. That, May, is elegance... Once you find peace and gain a bit of emotional leeway, you begin to see things you couldn't before.
     OR [MayElegance1]*: If you wish to fully utilize your skills, elegance is of the utmost importance. I don't think I would choose the word "elegant" to describe you in this instance... It's a style that would suit you very well, I think.

MAY STRIPPING BANDANA (accessory):
May [MayCynElegance2]*: So maybe I'm not the picture of elegance right now, but you should have seen me in the gown I wore for Queen Ilene's royal ball. I had like <i>five</i> petticoats under that thing!
Cynthia [MayElegance2]*: Sounds like you had a grand time in that royal ball. It wouldn't hurt at all if you invite me to any future balls you go to, right? I'm not one for fancy dresses, but I wouldn't mind dressing up once in a while.
     OR [MayElegance2]*: If you were invited to one of those in the future, who better to bring along than a League Champion? I might not be able to match your elegance, but I like to think I would look great in a poofy dress.

MAY STRIPPED BANDANA (accessory):
May [MayCynElegance3]*: I'll keep you in mind as a plus one then. The best balls are the ones where you can share the experience with a friend, right?
Cynthia [MayElegance3]*: Well, the purpose if a ball is to socialize, after all. I know my way around a ball or two, so I wouldn't look too out of place there. Perhaps, I could even teach you proper ettiquete.
     OR [MayElegance3]*: Mingling with stranger is nice, but it's always comforting to have a friendly face at a gathering like that. Besides, I feel like we would have a good chemistry while attendding formal functions.


MAY MUST STRIP SHORTS:
May [MayCynBug1]*: It used to be just bug Pokémon that scared my pants off. If I can make friends with them, I can do anything!
Cynthia [MayBug1]*: There's quite a few young trainers I've met that are terrified of bug Pokémon, May, and I didn't really have any idea how to help them. How did you get over your fear?
     OR [MayBug1]*: A phobia of bug Pokémon seems to be relatively common, especially among children, May. I'm curious as to how you managed to overcome your fear, so I can perhaps do the same for young trainer with the same fear.

MAY STRIPPING SHORTS (major):
May [MayCynBug2]*: A lot of things are scary until you realize they're not going to hurt you, you know? Even if sometimes they make you all sticky...
Cynthia [MayBug2]*: So you had a fear that bug-types would hurt you... It's easy to see how exposure to Pokémon helped you get over your fears. People tend to be intimidated by their rather unusual appearance on the other hand.
     OR [MayBug2]*: Finding out by yourself that Pokémon are not hostile does wonders in allaying your fear of them. Although, I know some people who are simply frightened by their mere appearance, and can't be persuaded otherwise.

MAY STRIPPED SHORTS (major):
May [MayCynBug3]*: Here's hoping exposure therapy will be good for me to~background.time~ too!
Cynthia [MayBug3]*: As far as this game is concerned, you're still in good shape at the moment. If you lose again, then the real test of will begins.
     OR [MayBug3]*: Keeping yourself calm and composed is key when attempting to conquer your fears. It must be said, the next time you lose, your ability to stay focused will undergo a mighty challenge.


MAY MUST STRIP SHIRT:
May [MayCynFriendly1]*: This is just a friendly game, right? I don't need to be <i>too</i> competitive.
Cynthia [MayFriendly1]*: Indeed! This is one of those games where you just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Oh, and get friendly with the other players too! 
     OR [MayFriendly1]*: You don't really receive a prize for winning, and we're all here to just enjoy the game, and each other's company. After all, this might be the only time we get to meet each other.

MAY STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
May [MayCynFriendly2]*: Yeah! If you think about it, this is more like a demolition derby than a battle. Only a real stick-in-the-mud would try to finish without showing anything fun.
Cynthia [MayFriendly2]*: I suppose people who are afraid to show off their bodies wouldn't have been participating in this game to begin with. Although, I came here for the new experience, rather than to explicitly see you naked, May.
     OR [MayFriendly2]*: Not wanting to strip completely misses the point of this game, May, but I do feel the need to point out that it's not that I came to see someone like you end up naked, but rather to simply experience something new.

MAY STRIPPED SHIRT (major)
May [MayCynFriendly3]*: It's okay, Cynthia. I won't tell anyone how much you're in love with me now, haha! Except Max. He'll believe anything!
Cynthia [MayFriendly3]*: I know you're joking, but I must admit that I find your figure admirable... in a non-sexual way of course...
     OR [MayFriendly3]*: I do find you body shape attractive, but not <i>that</i> attractive. It's not like that's a particularly believable story anyhow.


MAY MUST STRIP BRA:
May [MayCynHungry1]*: Anyone want to go out for something to eat? I'm starving. You hungry, Cynthia? We could take ~player~, all get to know each other a bit better, and come back later to~background.time~?
Cynthia [MayHungry1]*: That's an excellent idea, May! I know of an inexpensive but decent diner not far from here. Well, it's actually an inn with a diner. I've heard that the rooms there aren't bad at all, and they might be a good idea if the next game goes really late.
     OR [MayHungry1]*: Well, I wouldn't mind spending some quality time with both you and ~player~, May. I passed by an inn earlier that had a diner inside. We should go there after this game. Depending on how late it gets, staying there is an option too.

MAY STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
May [MayCynHungry2]*: After the game? Yeah. Of course. Wait, you mean stay overnight?! M-Maybe. Anyway, here's what you've all been waiting for...
Cynthia [MayHungry2]*: I just think that since we're all having fun here, we might end up staying up very late. Rather than risk going home while tired, we can just stay over for the night. I suppose we can rent a two-bed room to save on money.
     OR [MayHungry2]*: Well, I just think that since you're going home alone, having you do that while you're in an exhausted state might not be the smartest of ideas. Besides, if you're worried about money, they do have rooms with two beds, which is a cheaper deal.

MAY STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
May [MayCynHungry3]*: Three people, but two beds... um, who's sleeping with who? Not that I mind, I suppose. You've seen my body now anyway. Most of it.
Cynthia [MayHungry3]*: I have to admit that I did forget about ~player~ while pondering over that. What do you think, ~player~? Perhaps it might be easier to think about it once we've eaten a full meal after this.
     OR [MayHungry3]*: Hmm, I completely left out ~player~ when I was thinking about our room plans. Don't be sad, ~player~. I'm sure May and I can think of an arrangement with you. It might be best to talk about when we're eating at the diner after this.


MAY MUST STRIP SPATS:
May [MayCynCheer1]*: Ugh. Defeated. If you ~player.ifMale(guys|girls)~ want me to do this, it'd help me a lot if you supported me right now. Like a crowd cheering from the stands, you know?
Cynthia [MayCheer1]*: Not that I've been leering at you or anything, but you have an excellent body, May. Even if you eat a lot at the diner later, you'll still look very fit.
     OR [MayCheer1]*: I know for a fact that coordinators love having their appearance complimented, so all I can say that you have a stunning body, May. Not even eating a full meal at the diner can alter that fact.

MAY STRIPPING SPATS (revealing crotch):
May [MayCynCheer2]*: Haha, thanks! I have to work hard to eat so much and still keep this figure. Okay, here goes...
Cynthia [MayCheer2]*: It sure would be nice being able spend my time prancing around eating cake without having to worry about my waistline. We should do that soon... But enough of that! Let's see what you've got!
     OR [MayCheer2]*: Well, there's a lot of foreign cuisine I'd love to try if I wasn't so self-conscious about my weight. I bet you'd love them if we ever went out together... But, the task at hand.

MAY STRIPPED SPATS (revealed crotch):
May [MayCynCheer3]*: Here's what's on the menu today. Ahaha... Um, just kidding, of course.
Cynthia [MayCheer3]*: Hmm, that's an enticing way of putting it. Might be more of an acquired taste though.
     OR [MayCheer3]*: In a way, you can say that it's very exotic. I doubt many people have tasted it, even if there any at all.
