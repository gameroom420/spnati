        <title>Aura Camera</title>
        <subtitle>"Can't you tell just by looking?"</subtitle>
        <text>A futuristic camera made by Parfet Balblair, Chief Engineer on the Nirvana.  Given to their young nurse Paiway as a toy with which she can "Pai-check" racy situations.&lt;br&gt;In addition to regular photos, it can reveal the "emotional wavelengths" given off by the subject.  Their Paksis Pragma fusion core feeds off of these to produce energy.  Perhaps the same is true of all living things.</text>

        <title>Flightsuit</title>
        <subtitle>Comfortable, practical, and very flattering.</subtitle>
        <text>Standard-issue among all Magno's Family pilots---pilfered from Mejare imperials.  As Chief Pilot, Meia wears full armor instead, so her suit lacks the shoulder pads.  Too bad you don't get the bust boost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels like a second skin---anything you wear beneath would show through.  But despite its tightness, it's both strong and breathable.  There's extra give around the chest and hips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You get the impression Mejare has spent a lot of time on its craftsmanship.</text>
