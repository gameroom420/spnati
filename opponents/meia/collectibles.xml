        <subtitle>Comfortable, practical, and very flattering.</subtitle>
        <text>Standard-issue among all Magno's Family pilots---pilfered from Mejare imperials.  As Chief Pilot, Meia wears full armor instead, so her suit lacks the shoulder pads.  Too bad you don't get the bust boost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels like a second skin---anything you wear beneath would show through.  But despite its tightness, it's both strong and breathable.  There's extra give around the chest and hips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You get the impression Mejare has spent a lot of time on its craftsmanship.</text>
        <unlock>Take Meia to a place she likes.</unlock>
