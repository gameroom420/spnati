                <state img="#-pleased.png">I guess my strategy always &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; to charge forward and attack.  I even shed armor in favor of thrusters.</state>
                <state img="#-pleased.png">I'll still take nudity over panicking rookie pilots.  In fact, nudity is a good way to make them panic.</state>

                <state img="#-addressing.png">...It's almost liberating, playing naked like this.  I can forget about embarrassment and focus on winning.</state>
                <state img="#-stretch.png">...&lt;i&gt;Hah.&lt;/i&gt;  I should take up yoga--hot yoga, to let myself sweat.  I could teach a class on our ship...</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png">Just like how our bodies are the same, it was comforting to see how Earth is a blue planet, the same as Mejare.  Even your neighbor Mars is red, like Tarak.</state>

                <state img="#-butt.png">I've received compliments about my shapely butt.  But my back is exposed, too...it's got some of a woman's most important muscles.</state>

                <state img="#-butt.png">My armor exaggerates my chest, but my suit can lift up my butt, as well.  Does it still look toned when I'm naked?</state>

                <state img="#-butt.png">Breasts are fat, while the butt is muscle.  That's why a nice backside isn't out of reach for "sporty" girls.</state>
                <state img="#-butt.png">So many women think strengthening their butts' muscles will ruin the soft plumpness fat gives them.  Muscle is just as soft as long as you don't flex it.</state>

                <state img="#-aside.png">Obviously this doesn't bother me, but our male prisoners grew up terrified of women.  They'd be expecting some barbed tentacle to slither out of you.</state>

                <state img="#-aside.png">You can do this at your own pace.  I knew street gangs on Mejare who would mug and strip girls for entertainment.</state>

                <state img="#-confused.png">I can't think of how showing your groin would be all that embarrassing.  Maybe if you're unshaven, or your labia protrude out too much.</state>
                <state img="#-embarrassed.png">Are you...?  The most intimate part of a woman...I feel lucky to still have my shorts covering it.</state>
                <state img="#-awkward.png">...This is even more personal than breasts.  I pictured seeing a man strip, but I'm so used to my crewmates, I didn't think about the effect a strange woman stripping might have on me...</state>

                <state img="#-pleased.png">...Maybe I should let myself be more excited about this.  If I stared at a &lt;i&gt;crewmate&lt;/i&gt; rolling down her underwear, it'd haunt me every mission afterwards.</state>
                <state img="#-impressed.png">...I guess I don't know for sure that Mejarians and Earth women are the same.  It might not be that old, but just living around men might change your body.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">...This feels more mundane with girls.  Men have those tubes of theirs, but all we can show off is how we groom ourselves.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">Man or woman...either way, this is a glorified strip show for me.  One just causes more confusing feelings.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">...I guess this is what we all really wanted, playing this game.  Or at least, we accepted the risk so we could see others do it.</state>

                <state img="#-confused.png">Completely nude...men's presence might have &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; effect that would make us different there.  Hormone changes, or even the way they touch you.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">...This is another way men and women are opposites.  Men have bare chests, but something on their groins that varies in size.  Women have unique breasts, but our groins look similar.</state>
                <state img="#-aside.png">...I guess there can't be too many surprises here.  Maybe how you groom your pubic hair, or how your labia are shaped.</state>

                <state img="#-defensive.png">I hope men appreciate how sensitive women's breasts can be.  You can get rough with yourself or a partner lower down, but I'd only want a massage for my chest.</state>
                <state img="#-advising.png">...Men put so much of themselves on display with those tubes, don't they?  All we do is get increasingly wet until it starts to spill onto our thighs.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">Without any romantic options on our crew, I'm left to do this myself in my quarters a lot.  I like to lie on my bed, lift my hips up, and cup one of my breasts...I usually just use my imagination.</state>

                <state img="#-embarrassed.png">I could never masturbate this hard without being alone in my room...you're just so vulnerable, sitting back and placing your fingers between your legs.</state>
                <state img="#-confused.png">...It's strange to just watch a girl masturbate.  On my homeworld, that's an invitation for you to come over and help her.</state>
                <state img="#-defensive.png">...Do men ever just embrace you like women do on Mejare?  Putting a hand between your legs?  I guess you could wrap yours around his tube.</state>
                <state img="#-curious.png">Fingering and toys are usually seen as foreplay where I'm from.  Women truly show they love each other when one offers to use her mouth.</state>

                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">I think the captain made me an officer so I wouldn't get too reckless.  But it also means I can't pursue a relationship with most of my crewmates...I have authority over them.</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">Every so often, I hear locker-room gossip about where crewmates have been caught masturbating.  Our engineer near the core, Belvedere in the ready room...not everyone has private quarters.</state>

                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">This is...kind of nostalgic.  Not just for Mejare, but...because of the girls I used to hang out with in bars.  Half the time, they'd have breasts hanging out, groping each other in the booths.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png">...I feel like I never talk this much.  Maybe it's from being with strangers...civilians.  Where I don't owe you anything, or have a rank over you.</state>
                <state img="#-awkward.png">Is this...is another girl watching you really so unnatural here?  Our bodies look the same...we'd understand each other better as partners.</state>

                <state img="#-defensive.png">...Do you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; let men shove their rods inside you?  And even when they're finished, they've shot some fluid from their bodies into yours...</state>
                <state img="#-reminiscing.png">...Have you been in a relationship, ~name~?  I had a girlfriend when I was younger, but--I still spent most of my time alone then.</state>

                <state img="#-embarrassed.png">Your--lips.  They're swelling up, getting wetter...maybe we're not so different from men and their erections, after all.</state>
                <state img="#-awkward.png">...I don't--stumble over my words this way when I'm leading the squadron.  I've never been good with romance...</state>
                <state img="#-aside.png">...I talk about men being rough, but Mejare's street thugs were the same way.  All I knew about sex was forcing your tongue down your partner's throat, or forcing her head between your legs.</state>
                <state img="#-aside.png">I guess...on Mejare or on Earth, you'll find girls willing to spread their legs for strangers if you head to the bars.</state>
                <state img="#-advising.png">...Even if I can't ask out a subordinate, I'm glad I joined the Magno Family just so I could see girls in healthy relationships.  I hope you've found those with men, at least.</state>
                <state img="#-confused.png">...Do you do some kind of stretches to make sure men's tubes slide in properly?  Spreading your lips, or putting a finger inside...lifting your hips up.</state>

                <state img="#-impressed.png">...~name~?  Uh...I can offer card advice, but masturbation...that seems like something you should explore alone.</state>
                <state img="#-awkward.png">...~name~.  Do men use their mouths with you?  I don't mean--&lt;i&gt;kissing.&lt;/i&gt;  Going down on your partner is the mark of a more serious couple on Mejare...</state>
                <state img="#-defensive.png">Lovers on Mejare will usually progress from their fingers to their tongues down there.  Wait...do you &lt;i&gt;lick&lt;/i&gt; men's penises?</state>
                <state img="#-pleased.png">If I really had to pick a crewmate to ask out...Valore shares my rank, at least.  She's irreverent where I'm stoic.</state>
