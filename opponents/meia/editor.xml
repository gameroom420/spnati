    <othernotes>Summary&lt;br&gt;- Young fighter pilot for a spacecraft.  Leads a team of pilot girls around her age (high school/college).&lt;br&gt;- Pirate crew.  ~100-150 women, 3 male prisoners.&lt;br&gt;- Home planet Mejare, Earth colony.  Population is all female.  Women form couples and families there.&lt;br&gt;- Mejare is at war with neighboring planet, all-male Tarak.  Each does not see the other sex as human.&lt;br&gt;- Other colonies exist with other societies.  Earth has been attacking colonies to harvest colonists' organs.&lt;br&gt;- Once wealthy as a child, like many of her crewmates.  Rendered homeless in an energy disaster.  Lived as a street thug for several years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personality&lt;br&gt;- Stoic, unfriendly.  Speaks directly and deliberately.  Emotionally reserved.  However, she takes others' problems seriously if they open up to her.&lt;br&gt;- Impulsive and competitive, which she keeps in check with her responsibilities.  Has to keep herself busy.  Secludes herself, dislikes gossip.&lt;br&gt;- Watching for threats.  Brought a laser gun--her ring.&lt;br&gt;- Always wants to prove herself, do things herself, see things for herself, etc.&lt;br&gt;- Respects men, but wary of them.  Respects peers/older women.  Willing to offer advice to younger girls.&lt;br&gt;- Asks a lot of direct, impersonal questions.&lt;br&gt;- Wants to learn more about men.  Unsure how to feel about her sexuality.&lt;br&gt;- Attracted to girls, but has a negative sexual history.  Feels awkward/unwanted in romance.&lt;br&gt;- Ice can thaw, but takes earnestness--and a spine.  Don't waste her time, don't be afraid to push back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Topics/Touchstones&lt;br&gt;- Men's anatomy/physiology/behavior/desires (e.g. no periods, they like big breasts)&lt;br&gt;- Male/female relationships, experience (e.g. Meia has no concept of birth control)&lt;br&gt;- any flight/space travel/combat experience or technology unique to your character's setting&lt;br&gt;- diet/exercise/combat training&lt;br&gt;- info about Earth&lt;br&gt;- positive F/F relationships/interest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad/Overdone Topics&lt;br&gt;- "How do two women make babies?"  Gene splicing.  Normal pregnancy.&lt;br&gt;- "What does your headpiece do?"  Nothing.&lt;br&gt;- "Your armor/suit is really advanced!"  They're not, even by our standards.&lt;br&gt;- "omg u r an alien"  She's a human.&lt;br&gt;- general questions about Mejare, her rank, ship, crew, etc. UNLESS you have a good followup in mind.  Meia gives simple, direct answers.&lt;br&gt;- In other words, don't treat her like a loredump machine.  Ask something that your character would have an opinion on the answer to.&lt;br&gt;- In the same vein, don't ask "yes" or "no" questions without an idea for further expansion.&lt;br&gt;- her past (OK sometimes, I can write a lot, just generally a downer)&lt;br&gt;- general obnoxiousness or playing games.  She'll just decide it's not worth it.</othernotes>
