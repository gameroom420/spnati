        <subtitle>Chazz's first boss monster.</subtitle>
        <text>Chazz's first ever boss monster... that he totally didn't steal from Kaiba, no siree. Crowler stole it, and then gave it to The Chazz.
"Keep my Dragon Cannon. I've got 20 of these in my trunk. But when we duel, I'll show off an even stronger form of it who's power you can only imagine."</text>

        <subtitle>Chazz's favorite and most hated card.</subtitle>
        <text>Chazz has a tsundere relationship with this card. It's got him out of some sticky situations, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a revolting mutant slug that loves to jiggle it's butt around.
"I'll let you borrow my most "powerful" monster. He's powerful in the sense that Jaden is "smart". But you can never get too far away from him. He won't let you."</text>
        <unlock>Play with The Chazz. Just play with him.</unlock>

        <title>Chazz's Wild Adventure</title>
        <subtitle>He was right all along.</subtitle>
        <text>Chazz really did become a werewolf after all. Though he eventually wants to become human again, for now he's happy as a savage beast. Now Jaden will never know that he's the one that pissed on his moped.</text>
