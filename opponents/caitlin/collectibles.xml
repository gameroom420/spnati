        <text>Caitlin had many restless nights growing up, and this did not chang upon reaching Unova. Seeing his bags under his pupil's eyes, Champion Alder gave the girl a Pok√©mon egg. In learning to care for the egg, Caitlin found patience, and learned to care for something other than herself. When it hatched, she met her first friend, and never had trouble sleeping again.
