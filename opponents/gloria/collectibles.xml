        <title>Gloria's Tam O' Shanter</title>
        <text>A tam o' shanter, or "tammie", is a name given to the traditional Scottish bonnet, usually worn by men. The fact that Gloria wears one by default immediately led the Pok√©mon fanbase to give her the fanon personality of speaking like a foul-mouthed Scottish lass. And now, you can wear it, too!</text>
