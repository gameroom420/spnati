        <title>Deck of Pok√©mans Cards</title>
        <subtitle>Gotta collect all of them!</subtitle>
        <text>A premade deck of collectible Pocket Humans cards, such as Sanjeet Chaudhari and Sarah Paulson. Would be very confusing if mixed into a poker deck.</text>
        <unlock>See Aaravi level up her poker skill. This can only happen if she's still in the game after 30 total rounds. If you face her in a location where learning is encouraged, you might be able to help her accumulate that experience more quickly.</unlock>
