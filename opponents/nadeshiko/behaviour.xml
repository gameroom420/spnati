There's a lot to do in the great outdoors! </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1175" marker="CampingTips_Packing" font-size="small">When packing for a camping trip, it's helpful to have a list of everything you're going to need to take.

                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1312" marker="CampingTips_Tents" font-size="smaller">A lot of first-time campers tend to struggle with choosing a tent. A good tent is something that fits your needs as a camper. A good rule of thumb is to take the number of campers staying in a tent, and then add one to it, and that's how many people can comfortably fit in it. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1908" marker="CampingTips_Campfires" font-size="smaller">On occasion, I'll meet people who aren't sure what kind of wood to use in their campfires. Most campsites have bundles of firewood for sale, but if you want to gather your own, you have to find dry wood, because wet wood will either prevent your fire from burning, or cause the flames to pop.</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="2263" marker="CampingTips_WhereToCamp" font-size="smaller">I've met a lot of first-time campers who are unsure as to where they should go on their first trip. It depends on the kind of experience you want, but its important to do plenty of research beforehand to know where you're going, and what the temperatures are there, giving you a better idea of what to pack. </state>
                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="3360" marker="CampingTips_Relaxing" font-size="small">I've seen people who tend to stress about every aspect of a camping trip. However, What's most important is for you to relax and enjoy yourself! Take time to do things at your own pace, and I can guarantee you'll have a good trip!</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="3556" marker="CampingTips_Pets">Some people like to bring their pets with them when they go camping. However, not all pets are a fan of the cold, so consider bundling them up, or leaving them with a pet sitter at home. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="3748" marker="CampingTips_SleepingBags">When camping, choosing the right sleeping bag is important. Keep in mind that certain bags are better for different kinds of weather. Winter sleeping bags are thicker, keeping you toasty when you sleep! </state>
                <state img="#-ecstatic.png" oneShotId="3813" marker="CampingTips_Campsites">There are three kinds of "standard" campsites, open field campsites, forest campsites, and my favorite, lake campsites! Which kind of site you choose to camp at is up to you, as each has their own pros and cons. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="4455" marker="CampingTips_OutsideActivities">When me and my friends went camping, we would enjoy experiences outside the campsite, such as visiting a hot spring or a café! If you plan accordingly, it can help to enhance your camping experience a lot! </state>
                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="4579" marker="CampingTips_KindsofCamping">I've had many first time campers ask me what actually counts as camping. Aside from tent camping, staying in an RV, or even a cabin can count! It's ultimately up to what you want to do!</state>

                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="2957" font-size="small">There are so many places around the world I'd love to camp at. For instance, there are a number of camping hotspots in the United States I'd love to visit, especially Colorado. The sight of rivers running along rocky cliffsides really capture the imagination!</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="3285">I've always wanted to try playing songs around a campfire! I've been looking to buy a harmonica and learn to play, but college classes don't exactly afford me that luxury.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="3578">Whenever I go camping, I'm always in awe of the natural beauty around me. Somebody once called it "Nature's Wonderland", and it's not hard to see why! That's part of the joy of being in the great outdoors!</state>
                <state img="#-excited.png" oneShotId="4046">Aside from camping and cooking, I've also come to really love trains. I travel on a lot of trains to travel to the campsites I visit, and I find riding on them to be so much fun!</state>
                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="4168">Do any of you have a favorite place you enjoy visiting time and time again? For me, that's easily Lake Motosu and Mount Fuji. There's something truly magical about seeing it from across the lake...</state>
                <state img="#-thinking.png" oneShotId="4172">Despite all the outdoor activities I've done, I'll admit that I'm not much of a hiker. I've walked the campsite pathways and the occasional nature trail, but not much beyond that.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="4535">I've always found it really to cool to talk to people about their hobbies, especially when they're as passionate about them as I am about camping. The passion you hear in their voices is amazing!</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="4702">It feels really nice to take a break from the hustle and bustle from Tokyo for awhile. I've been attending college there, and while it is nice, all the activity can be draining.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="4811">Everything and anything tastes good to me, but my favorite is curry noodles! </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="4858">I hope you're having a great day today, ~player~. Isn't it nice to unwind after a long, busy day?</state>
                <state img="#-ecstatic.png" oneShotId="5691">One of my favorite parts of camping is getting to admire the beautiful views. There's something so captivating about seeing Mount Fuji from across Lake Motosu, or city lights from a mountainside.</state>
                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="5814" marker="SoundAdvice">Remember to be kind to yourself, ~player~. remember to relax and take it easy every once in awhile, and take some time to do the things you enjoy most in life. </state>
                <state img="#-thinking.png" oneShotId="6437">When I was looking at colleges to attend, I originally wanted to study abroad in Colorado. However, my family couldn't afford to send me that far, so I ended up attending college in Tokyo.</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="7165">When I go camping, I almost never drive to the campsite. I usually like to take the train, or even ride my bike there if it's close enough! It makes the journey feel more like an adventure!</state>
