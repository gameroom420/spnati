                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="1149" marker="CampingTips_WinterCamping" font-size="smaller">Some people are hesitant to give winter camping a try because of the cold. While that's completely understandable, It's actually not bad. You've just got to be prepared. As long as you pack warm clothes, and have a warm tent and sleeping bag, you're pretty much good to go! </state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="1150" marker="CampingTips_CampActivities" font-size="small">I often meet people who find camping to be quite boring. However, there are plenty of things to do! You can walk around the campsite, cook, read a book, draw, and, at lake campsites, you can even go fishing or boating! There's a lot of fun to be had in the great outdoors! </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1175" marker="CampingTips_Packing" font-size="small">When packing for a camping trip, it's helpful to have a list of everyone you're going to need to take.

                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1312" marker="CampingTips_Tents" font-size="smaller">A lot of first-time campers tend to struggle with choosing a tent. A good tent is something that fits your needs as a camper. A good rule of thumb is to take the number of campers staying in a tent, and then add one to it, and that's how many people can comfortably fit in it. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1386" marker="CampingTips_SummerVsWinterCamping" font-size="smaller">I've encountered a number of amateur campers who think winter camping is no different than summer camping. However, both summer and winter camping have their own, unique challenges which requires different kinds of gear, such as bug spray or sunscreen for summer, or warm clothes for winter. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="1908" marker="CampingTips_Campfires" font-size="smaller">On occasion, I'll meet people who aren't sure what kind of wood to use in their campfires. Most campsites have bundles of firewood for sale, but if you want to gather your own, you have to find dry wood, because wet wood will either prevent your fire from burning, or cause the flames to pop.</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="2263" marker="CampingTips_WhereToCamp" font-size="smaller">I've met a lot of first-time campers who are unsure as to where they should go on their first trip. It depends on the kind of experience you want, but its important to do plenty of research beforehand to know where you're going, and what the temperatures are there, giving you a better idea of what to pack. </state>
                <state img="#-relaxed.png" oneShotId="3360" marker="CampingTips_Relaxing" font-size="small">I've seen people who tend to stress about every aspect of a camping trip. However, What's most important is for you to relax and enjoy yourself! Take time to do things at your own pace, and I can guarantee you'll have a good trip!</state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="3556" marker="CampingTips_Pets">Some people like to bring their pets with them when they go camping. However, not all pets are a fan of the cold, so consider bundling them up, or leaving them with a pet sitter at home. </state>
                <state img="#-calm.png" oneShotId="3748" marker="CampingTips_SleepingBags">When camping, choosing the right sleeping bag is important. Keep in mind that certain bags are better for different kinds of weather. Winter sleeping bags are thicker, keeping you toasty when you sleep! </state>
                <state img="#-happy.png" oneShotId="3813" marker="CampingTips_Campsites">There are three kinds of "standard" campsites, open field campsites, forest campsites, and my favorite, lake campsites!
