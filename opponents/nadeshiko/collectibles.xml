        <text>Out of the kindness of her heart, Nadeshiko has gifted you a tasty cup of ramen noodles, on the bottom of the cup, there's a note: 

"I was given a cup of these very noodles when I met Rin for the first time, so I decided to pay the favor onto you! All you need to do is boil some water, pour it in the cup, and the 2-3 minutes later, you'll have tasty ramen, ready to go! I hope you enjoy them!" -Nadeshiko</text>
