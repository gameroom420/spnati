We even talked to so many other people, like some strangers and even our own friends, but at the end of the day, the result was clear-- or, I guess it was actually unclear. Our Girl Power just couldn't be measured to compete with each other, 'cuz we just had lots of cute points! So remember: Girl Power isn't a competition, even if I may or may not make it out to be one!

So he gave us the money, which to be honest, I wasn't even sure he was gonna do since he made such a big fuss about it, but we were attacked by, like, a lot of beasts! And I mean a LOT of beasts. Too many beasts! Us Blades can handle ourselves, but we're still a heck of a lot weaker without our Drivers.

I don't think I've every seen her without it. So anyway, my makeup in there and I have to reach in there and get it while Sheba is worrying that I ruined her bath water. So I take off my glove and go in. I got it, but I saw her making a weird smirk when I was reaching.
