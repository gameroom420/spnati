I think the best one, considering the low risk, is buying goods from one island at a high discount, and then selling them in the next island at twice the original price. The trick is finding a pushover vendor that you can manipulate without much trouble. I've gotten 90% discounts barely trying. It's even easier if you buy merchandise that's already cheap. Like buying hot weather clothing at a winter island, and then selling it at a summer island. Easy peasy.</text>
