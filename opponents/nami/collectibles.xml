        <text>"T-Take a picture of me...! Right now...!" Nami said, between moans, while you two were having sex for the third time today. As soon as the game ended,  you and Nami went to a hotel room to continue what you had started. She had already taken her clothes off before the door was closed.
So, per her request, you snapped a picture of her in this blissful moment, her body glistening with sweat while she moans with pleasure.
"This way you'll always remember me, no matter how far away I am. I want you to use this when you feel like you miss me..."
She also took a picture of you, for her own use.</text>
