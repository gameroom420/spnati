        <title>Don Patch Sword</title>
        <subtitle>Don Patch's purportedly magic sword. Now that you're holding it, you're certain it's just a green onion.</subtitle>
        <text>Don Patch carries this ordinary vegetable into battle, and more often than not gets his ass handed to him as a result. It's supposed to be magic or at least a high-quality vegetable, but it's astonishingly mundane. But maybe in the hands of a Legendary Warrior...</text>

        <subtitle>A plush doll that looks just like Dengakuman!</subtitle>
        <text>Dengakuman is a former hair hunter, leader of fearsome Z-Block Headquarters. Z-Block was supposed to be the weakest of the Block Bases, but due to an accounting error they became the strongest. Now he's on Bobobo's side, and despite being an inaffectual fighter played a vital role in one fight...</text>

        <subtitle>The Duel Monsters card "Slifer the Sky Dragon."</subtitle>
        <text>Yugi left this behind when he showed up during the game. He really ought to be more careful with his possessions. Speaking of which, you misplaced one of the playing cards in the deck. Better slip this in there and hope nobody notices...</text>
