                <state img="custom:#-dpool-idea" marker="DP speak" location="75%">This week on Nature’s Encounters we will be on the hunt for the reclusive and evasive golden snapping beaver. It prefers a moist surrounding and is very sensitive to close contact. The beaver is known to vary its pelt from a full think length to having none at all. Its allies, the hard-nippled hooters, often warn of potential encounters with its natural predator, the lurking one-eyed grass snake. In defense, the snapping beaver will often envelop the snake whole and drain it of all its bodily fluids, causing the snake to be rendered unconscious. These encounters often leave the snapping beaver worked up and needing to release its pent up energy on its own. When the beaver is not hiding in its various constructions of artificial camouflage, often it practices taunting mating-like dance motions meant to confuse its predator, the grass snake, who at other times it avoids at all costs. This very confusing behavior has caused many grass snakes to go completely mad. Often when the snapping beaver has no natural predators in sight it will often fashion tools to assist it in practice for such next encounters. There are sparse rumors of hunters being able to train a snapping beaver and domesticate it, but remember, these are wild animals and this should only be left to those fully trained in dealing with them properly. Severe maiming has resulted otherwise. The golden snapping beaver; beautiful but deadly.</state>
