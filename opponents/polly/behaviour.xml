We try to be ourselves, to express our thoughts and show off our personality, to stand out from the crowd, even in the smallest of details like this fast, almost insignificant phase of swapping cards. But the more we try to stand out, the more we're being drowned by our own identities. When you enter this place, people instantly ask "What do you bring to the table that's never seen before?" while at the same time, the management is very wary of who and what they allow in this fine establishment. I respect their authority, since they've been running this place for Бог knows how long. And it's going well, so they must be doing something right. However, whenever a new face shows up trying to improve the place, some see it as a possible threat, while others are far more logical and analyitical on their approach. Is this person known and beloved by the masses? Then they shall be allowed, well, as long as they comply with the basic rules. Rules that, I must say, I completely adhere to. Especially the one where they refuse anything that's not consensual. That alone made me respect them a lot, since the bases for a responsible sex life are safety, sanity and consent. However, they are still human, and they still fear the new faces that might bring new ideals if they're relatively unknown or have a bad reputation. As my dear Dostoyevsky once said: "Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most." And yet, slowly but surely, they give their best attempt to embrace with open arms all different kinds of kinks and fetishes, as long as they're not dangerous. And that alone makes this place a place I want to be in. A place where Polina Geist can feel safe, and wants to contribute nothing but good fun and laughs. Well, this is where this small rant of mine ends. Congratulations if you've read all this, it means a lot to me. Now, why don't we keep playing and enjoy ourselves? I can't wait to share some laughs, lose my clothes and get down to it like a wild cockatrice in a shopping mall! </state>

Don't get me started on chess! Like, I thought you'd know since you're a streamer and chess has been like one of THE most popular games played in every streaming platform for years now! With millions of people getting into it everyday! But I get it, it might seem weird for those who aren't into it and can't see the good shit. So let me break it down for ya. Chess. Is. Amazing. You've got your 16 pieces, and aside from the pawns each one does something different, right? As soon as you make your first move and the opponent makes theirs, you've already got like 400 possible board setups possible! And after that? There's like 200,00, and then up to 120 million! You can't memorize every play because that'd be impossible! So you gotta be always on top of your game, you gotta adapt to the situation you're in and perhaps change your strategy if you were going into it. You gotta study strategies to approach with a plan and be able to switch them depending on the board and your opponent's strategy. You're thinking three moves ahead, but you also have to predict your opponent's moves, or even if they know how to play or not! And if they do, what kind of strategy are they using? Are they still using it? Are they gonna change? Also, unrelated shit, do you know how to play piano? Do you know how after hours, days, years of playing piano people can just zone out and play whatever and it might sound good because they're just that good, because their subconscious is used to the creation of music and the keys have become a part of their body? Well, turns out that WAS related shit, because that's exactly how chessmasters can think! After years of playing, they can get REALLY good at it, and even autoplay while doozing off and thinking about groceries and shit! Hell, it becomes even trippier when you play chess while you're high because your mind starts doing all kinds of crazy shit! You can slow time and get the lead on a blitz! You can get baked as shit and change strategies on the fly, becoming an unpredictable menace! You can get high on coke and become a rabid insatiable chess monster that plays aggresively while doing lines with the pieces you've collected for maximum BM! Have you tried giving a blowjob while dealing with a Sicillian Defense? You have NEVER played chess if you haven't given a blowjob to some dude while you were kicking his ass by coming up with a Smith–Morra gambit to break his impenetrable defense! And speaking of impenetrable, getting penetrated by a guy while trying to apply pressure with a wrong bishop because you're in zugzwang and don't want to break your strategy is a mix of emotions so good it's one of the greatest highs you can get! Your mind is working at 100%, your body is overstimulated to the max, and if you're high and getting even more stimuli from everything, it all becomes... ecstasy! Even without actual ecstasy! I'm telling you, it's an amazing game, my mom was a champion of it and taught me to play from a very early age, and while she doesn't really get my way of enjoying it I still kick asses and win tournaments so we can still bond talking about it! You should try playing it sometime for your viewers, I'm sure you'd get a huge boost from at least giving it a try!</state>
