    <othernotes>Zeke is the leader of this duo, and as such all targets will be going towards him by default.&lt;br&gt;Pandoria is accompanying him because the two work best as a pair, and would be much weaker if they were made separately. Pandoria will be present 95% of the time, and will only disappear in very specific circumstances (e.g. specific targeted interactions or the like). Therefore, when targeting them you can assume that she is always there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeke is a flamboyant swordsman with a flare for the dramatic, and an unlucky streak a mile long. Accompanied by his Blade, companion, and all-around handler Pandoria. Disowned from the Tantalese throne by his father, Zeke and Pandoria traveled across Alrest in search of the Aegis Blade, eventually joining forces with them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Zeke's age is outright stated to be 25 in XC2; I am treating him as vaguely older than that in case anyone ever wants to make Rex from XC3:FR&lt;br&gt;- Pandoria's age is harder to estimate as her species, a Blade, has a life cycle where they go into a dormant 'Core Crystal' stage until they are awakened with new memories but the same personality. She could be hundred of years old, but has only been awakened for at least a dedade.&lt;br&gt;- Both of them strip at the same time. The strip order is as follows:&lt;br&gt;-- gloves/gloves (extra)&lt;br&gt;-- pauldrons/dress (minor/major)&lt;br&gt;-- coat/bra (major/important)&lt;br&gt;-- boots/boots (minor)&lt;br&gt;-- pants/shorts (major)&lt;br&gt;-- boxers / panties (important)&lt;br&gt;- Zeke and Pandoria are both filling out the same 'space' at the table, but between them they aren't taking the game seriously enough to have an AI above 'average' - at least under normal circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are also accompanied by their mascot, a turtle named Turters. Turters goes missing during the game and is a collectible the player can unlock by finishing a game with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Zeke is a chuunibyou (someone who talks and acts like they are an over the top fantasy character), of the 'actually has incredible powers' variety. He does this as a bit of an act, as while he is generally goofy, he has a lot of hidden depth and worldly insight to offer. He's well-versed in the politics of his world, and is capable of incredible feats.&lt;br&gt;- He's a Blade Eater; part of Pandoria's Core Crystal was transplanted onto his heart by Amalthus before the events of the game in order to save his life. This is a bit of a taboo topic in the setting.&lt;br&gt;- Zeke refuses to take a life except as an absolute last resort, holding it as one of his greatest strengths that he never takes the easy way out.</othernotes>
