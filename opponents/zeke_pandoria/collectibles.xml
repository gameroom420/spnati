        <text>Zeke and Pandoria have a few different ways of 'forfeiting' the game.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normally, they will reach a climax by doing intercrural/thigh sex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; If they and every opponent (but the winner) is out of the game, or if they are playing with someone who also has the 'tandem' tag, they may have penetrative sex. There is a random chance this penetrative sex will be doggy style, or kneeling lotus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you pair them with Sucrose, there is also a chance they could show her a good time provided they all lose around the same point...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;  </text>
        <unlock>Zeke and Pandoria have some neat forfeit variations. Win a game against them to get this hint collectible.</unlock>
