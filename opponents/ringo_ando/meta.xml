    <description>Used to just be a student at Suzuran Junior High, until she got exposed to "the light". Now she has magical abilities which she uses by combining 4 or more "puyos" of the same color. She's quite curious... but also quite easily-distracted! (Also she doesn't do well with ghosts...)</description>
