How they evolve, if it requires certain criteria to be met like if the Pokémon requires an evolution stone, or maybe the Pokémon in question needs to fully trust their trainer enough to evolve. And don't even get me started on Pokémon that have incredibly specific evolutions. Like, the most common type of evolution is by battling and have them grow stronger. But then there's some that require to be traded to another trainer, and they also need to be holding a very specific item during the trade as well. Then there's some that can't evolve unless they're a specific sex, or have to evolve near a fricking &lt;i&gt;rock&lt;/i&gt;. Lastly, some need to be &lt;i&gt;held upside down&lt;/i&gt; to evolve!

Let's forget about my hubris for now. Besides, ~name~ is the one stripping.</state>

Only when I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; trying to get there.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I'll keep that in mind. That's something I'd like to try out in the future. Both ways, to be precise.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'm uh, up for that. Though, what do you think about ~name~'s nipples?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, right!

It's very discriminatory double standard.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, absolutely. I think it's a gross double standard that guys easily take advantage of. That being said, I wouldn't partake in uh, &lt;i&gt;freeing myself&lt;/i&gt;, for probably a long while if it were legal tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Kalos has no restrictions when it comes to toplessness in beaches.

I appreciate all you're doing to affirm my boundaries. But don't worry, I would let you know if I was comfortable or not with certain things beforehand.

If you catch my meaning, hehe.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Well, I suppose teaching you a thing or two about &lt;i&gt;cave exploration&lt;/i&gt; wouldn't go amiss.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" font-size="small">{cynthia}Don't tell Professor Rowan I said this, but I think leaving it up to children to fill out the Pokédex was far from his brightest decisions.

My ornaments are one of a kind, so having you wear them would feel very special for me.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}...Cynthia, I want you to know that I am doing everything in my power to not burst into a blind fury of emotion ranging from sheer and utter happiness, to blubbering like an emotional wreck.</state>

I could give you my contact information so we can talk to each other even when we're both away.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I have my Pokétch, but I don't have an Xtransceiver. Don't suppose they're relatively inexpensive?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}They're not any more expensive than a Pokétch. Although, we can just buy one of those Holo Casters when we go on our date in Kalos. I've heard they're like an upgraded Xtransceiver.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah! Let's do that then! I'm not ready to let go of my Pokétch just yet, but it's probably time I upgrade anyways.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png">{cynthia}I should give you my number, Dawn. Just be careful not to call me in the middle of the night... except for &lt;i&gt;certain&lt;/i&gt; cases, I must add...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh don't worry, I don't plan on calling unless it's an emergency. Or y'know, if I'm in town and wanted to &lt;i&gt;study&lt;/i&gt;. Hehe.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" font-size="small">{cynthia}Oh, is the game not over yet? If this games takes much longer, we might not be able to go on a date after this. We'll just have to choose another day for that.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Wha--- Hey! C'mon guys! Hurry up and finish the game already!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Calm down a little, Dawn. I know your blood is all in the wrong places right now, but that's not how you talk to people having fun.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah, sorry. I'm still very much enjoying everyone. Just kinda got riled up in the heat of the moment.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="smaller">{dawn}If the game takes any longer, I'm probably just end up grabbing take out after this. I was really wanting to go on that date, but I'm feeling a little spent now.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}That's too bad. I guess the least I can do is give you a lift home on the back of my Garchomp. You still live in your old house in Sandgem Town, right?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}That's right! Sandgem is my home and I don't think I'll ever move out. Unless I had to for my job of course.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Well, there's another scenario I can think off... Ah, but it's too early for us to be discussing that.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Eh!? That's uh, tad too early to be thinking about. But I can tell you're very pleased.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png" font-size="smaller">{dawn}So wait, if I do the math right... ~Name~ lost their ~clothing~ just now, so then that means there should be... Ugh, never mind, math makes my head spin.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Were you always bad at math, or did my &lt;i&gt;assistance&lt;/i&gt; do quite a number to your mental faculties?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Hehe, uhh... Both, actually. I can tell you everything I know about evolution and recite the entire Sinnoh Pokédex. But math isn't my forte.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Math is an important life skill, Dawn. And I do intend to teach you math.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Wha--- Hold on! I know math, I'm just not good at it!</state>

                <state img="#-DawnThia 4.png">{dawn}Hah, you seem like you're already relieving a lot of stress. With the amount of staring you're doing, I'd say we're a big help.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}It goes both ways, by the way. Dawn has been fully aroused ever since you started, ~name~.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Don't give him any ideas. Or actually, if they're &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; ideas you can think about them all you want.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png">{cynthia}Since we've established that the no-touching rule is not enforced, I'm surprised ~name~ is content with touching himself... Not that I would want him to come to us... But just a random thought.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}As many of the fantasies I've had in my alone time, I don't think I'm ready to live those out just yet.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png">{cynthia}I would be devastated if you fooled around with ~name~, especially behind my back. I have no problems with you fantasizing about them as long as they remain exactly that: fantasies.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah, I would only do so with your consent. I didn't mean to make you concerned, judgment isn't my strong suite right now.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}The way ~name~ is stroking his penis back and forth almost looks barbaric. It doesn't look at all sensual.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}It doesn't look like it at all, but he looks like he's enjoying it. It looks pretty easy to do too, especially compared to what &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; have to do to orgasm.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}We can't rag on him too much for his form. I'm sure we all have looked odd at least once while trying to finish ourselves off.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah yes, people always look weird when they're trying to get off. But the same thing could be said about someone about to sneeze or what not.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I'm curious about your opinion of ~name~'s performance, Dawn.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Hehe, it looks fun. So hypnotic and simple, compared to us.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Indeed! No wonder men do it more often than women. But... I was more curious about your carnal thoughts about it.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ahh, well... My imagination was always my best friend when it came to thinking of what it was like. I'll be honest that I may still want to &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; it someday...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Let's discuss this again after our minds have cleared, and maybe we can come up with a setup we'll both be satisfied with.</state>

                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I'm enjoying this moment I get to spend with you, even if it is rather unconventional. But then again, nothing about our relationship so far has been conventional.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'll certainly say so far, despite it only have been like several minutes, our relationship is the most unorthodox I have ever seen. Not to complain of course.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}With the way things have been going, who knows how our relationship would progress by tomorrow? Ah, that's something we'll just have to wait and see. For now, we should just enjoy ~name~'s forfeit.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I won't enjoy it too much!</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 4.png">{dawn}Enjoying yourself, ~name~? Just let go and explore yourself. Hehe.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Dawn and I are inexperienced when it comes to male masturbation, so we would like to learn as much as we can from you.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh yeah, we'd like to learn as much as we can!</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png">{cynthia}I must say, watching ~name~ play with his... &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; in person is a lot more alluring than watching someone do it from behind a computer screen...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}They always say that every thing is better in person. ~Name~'s performance certainly lives up to that expectation.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}More than that, ~name~ raises the bar, in my eyes. It will be difficult for other men to live up to this display.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}I can see why men have an easier time achieving orgasm compared to women. It looks so simple, yet so pleasurable...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'm almost envious of ~name~. We have to get everything &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; right in order to orgasm, but all they gotta do is sit back and stroke it.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}It looks easy enough that inexperienced women like us can probably make ~name~ finish quickly... Not that I'm thinking of testing that theory, mind you.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Not willing to, &lt;i&gt; conduct field research&lt;/i&gt;? Hehe, kidding of course.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png">{cynthia}Based on what you see of ~name~'s forfeit, are you thinking what I'm thinking, Dawn?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Hmm... Uhh, they seem to be having a good time?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}...Right, they sure are... But so are we, right? I'm enjoying cuddling with you while watching ~name~ do his forfeit.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}There are quite a lot of phallic artifacts that can't be displayed in Celestic Town, but I can show them to you, Dawn.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, that would be pretty cool, I'd love to! … I wasn't too sure how else to phrase that without sounding like a weirdo that wants to see some penis shaped artifacts.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Nothing wrong with that. I must warn you though, some of them are quite detailed... A lot more detailed than what you're probably imagining right now.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I mean, those artifacts that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; on display are usually hit or miss when it comes to detail. I'm really curious now that you say that.</state>

I did it all the time during class, especially when it got really boring.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, I thought it was only me. I suppose it's sneakier in your case, since that's how you're supposed to sit with a miniskirt on in the first place.</state>

I've no idea what to do if they knew I heard or saw them in their most private moments.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I would suggest just walking out, and never speaking of it again.</state>

Well, we were seated like we are now, but you were facing towards me instead and... let's just say you wouldn't be able to talk, if you get what I mean...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Mmf... I'm not talking too much, am I...? I just, am still a little shocked about all this... Ahh...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Don't you worry about a thing, dear. Just let yourself get lost in the moment.</state>

Or is that just me...?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, that's a good idea also. Sleeping in your embrace... I wouldn't mind at all sleeping the entire day off in that case.</state>

Unless we begin snogging passionately, and even then, that might not be enough to attract attention.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, can we tease any paparazzi by k-kissing when we see them taking pictures..? Hehe...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}S-sure... I don't see any problems with playing it up for the cameras...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I know this is hardly an orthodox way of striking up a relationship...

I know this is not very traditional in terms of starting a relationship... But uh... Anh! It's still pretty nice...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I c-confessed my feelings to you, then minutes later, I'm already pleasuring you towards an orgasm... The least I could have done is to take you on a date first.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Hehe... Th-the date can wait... I'm happy just sharing this moment w-with you...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{dawn}Mmf... J-just curious... I won't have to worry about any jealous exes, right...?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Hmm?

We're just two women getting into a romantic relationship for the first time... I guess you can consider this our first &lt;i&gt;entry&lt;/i&gt; into romance...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah... Better late than never, heh...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}Out of curiosity, how often do you fantasize about me when you're m-masturbating?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah... It was actually more like, mmf! W-wet dreams... It always started on a couch, or a lounge chair...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, I see... Well, we shouldn't let your wet dreams be wet dreams, should we?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I-I must be dreaming at this rate...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}We can deal with all of that later. For now... well, there's only one way a wet dream ends, right? I can tell from your body language that we're getting there.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{dawn}It's been a while since I've actually done this... At least a few months... Ngh...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}That's quite a long time! But no matter, we can more than make up for it. I always say that quality is better than quantity, and this well worth the wait, isn't it?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Had I known this was gonna happen, I would've abstained for even longer... Hehe...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Is that so? I wonder how long you can actually go without... I would be thrilled to try that experiment...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ahh... I want to try that too...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png">{cynthia}Out of curiosity, do you s-squirt? Not that there's anything wrong if you do, but I just want to temper my expectations.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Nnh! Ah... Y-yeah, I guess I do...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Since I don't squirt myself... I'm c-curious how it f-feels like...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}It's like... A proper treat at the end of a long day... Mnn...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I'll make this a very special treat, then. Don't hold anything back.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png">{cynthia}How are you liking my technique? Should I be gentler with my fingers... or rougher?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}... A little rougher, please... Ah...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Ah, a little faster and deeper then... Now, how's this? Better?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh! Ah! Mmm...! Y-yeah...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png" font-size="small">{cynthia}Have you ever experienced feeling h-hot and bothered for no reason while you're deep in research? Ones where you can't continue until you get yourself o-off first?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh all the time... Strangely, it's like always around dusk...&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}It's so strange, isn't it?  Even worse when I'm on site, and I can't just easily excuse myself. I'm basically a dripping mess by the end of the day.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}There was a time I went skinny dipping in Lake Verity... That was an unforgettable evening...</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}If I pulled out and walked away at this very instant, how would you react?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Uhh... I would be very concerned I did something wrong... Is something wrong, Cynthia?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, it's nothing. I was just wondering how you would beg and whimper if I stop when you're nearing the edge... Now that I've said it out loud, it sounds a tad cruel...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, sorry I didn't read your intention right... Mmf!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}You need not worry about me leaving you alone. Just know that I'll be always by your side from now on.</state>

I didn't think you would be this good at this.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I surpassed even my own expectation. I thought I was just fumbling with my finger, but then you responded positively to it.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I hope I'm not being judgmental by assuming you're experienced, from what I can tell.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Funny you should say that, since this is the first time I've done anything like this with another woman, which is why I was concerned that I was doing it improperly.</state>

                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png">{cynthia}I hope you don't mind me asking, but were you a virgin before this?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah-- Uhh... Y-yes? I am-- er, was.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I'm glad that you lost it to someone special, and I'm accordingly honored by this occasion.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I'm anxious, when are we going to tell your parents... about us?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'm not so anxious. I imagine you must be, but I think my parents would be utterly speechless. Either by me getting with the champion, or something else I'm not sure of. Though what are we going to tell them if they ask how we got together?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}We can tell them that we met each other at Prof. Rowan's lab. They would also be surprised that you're into women, wouldn't they?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I know they wouldn't be against me having a girlfriend. It's not like they demand me to be straight.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" font-size="small">{dawn}So uh, are we still going on that date later? Not to sound too clingy, hehe.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I was also thinking about that. I might be able to pull some strings to get us a reservation in one of those high-class Lumiose City restaurants. I hope you don't mind fine dining.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah, I don't think I've ever actually had fine dining. This would be my first time in Lumiose City, and fine dining!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Some say fine dining is a bit of an acquired taste, but I say it mostly comes down to the choice of restaurant. Anyhow, I'm sure you would love it.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" font-size="small">{cynthia}You know, if you're not busy in the upcoming days, you should watch my next battle. I can reserve a premium seat for you, as my guest of honor. Would you love that gift?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, I'd love that! Gosh, I don't think I'd be able to make it up to you for doing that!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}You don't have to make anything up to me. Just knowing that you're there by my side is enough for me. Although, promise me that you'll actually watch the battle and not just stare at me the entire time.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png">{cynthia}I would greatly appreciate it if you could attend my next battle, Dawn.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Should I look nice for the event? Oh, what if someone comes up and starts asking questions? So much to think about, so little time!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}You don't really have to go out of your way to look good. Wearing one of your coordinator dresses would be good enough. And if anyone asks, I will handle it.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 2.png" oneShotId="1998" font-size="small">{dawn}So forgive me if you've been asked this before, but I'm just dying to know. Did you at one point actually use a jet to test your Garchomp's speed? How did you go about even making such a request?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, that story really has spread, but I shouldn't have been surprised. To answer your question, I was a guest of honor at an air show in Kanto, and someone suggested that I have Garchomp fly against the jet planes.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ohhh, that's really cool, not gonna lie. I'd love to see your Garchomp in action! Minus the jet of course.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I'm curious, but what have your Pokémon been up to since you stopped your coordinating career?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, my little Bidoof has retired to being a couch potato at my parents' place. Though my Torterra, Clefairy, and Kadabra are usually still helping me with field research and the like.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}It's been how many years since I last met your Pokémon? I still remember that your Torterra was still a Grotle back then. I'd love to meet your Pokémon team again.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Of course! I'm sure they'd recognize you on the spot. It'd be just like old times!</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 5.png" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}Have you ever been to the Unova region, Dawn?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I have not. It would be a little low on my list of places to explore for field research once I became a professor, why do you ask?&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}I have a summer villa in Undella Town which I use for vacation every year. We can go for an extended break there, and I could even introduce you to my local friends.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Gosh Cynthia, at this rate, you're gonna spoil me! I'd love to, but I don't want to come off as materialistic.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Oh, don't worry a thing about it. This one's on me.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 1.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}I know this a bit of an odd question, but what do you think my age is?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Aha... Uhh, late twenties? &lt;i&gt;(I'm totally gonna upset her if I told her what I actually first thought...)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Aww, you look so cute when you're thinking hard! Care to take another guess?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh! Um, mid thirties? You couldn't possibly be much older, unless I am completely off about how old you were when we last talked.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}Your face when you're in deep thought is simply the best! Oh, and I'm not telling my age either...&lt;br&gt;{dawn}No fair.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="small">{cynthia}You know, I have an unhatched Togepi egg back at my house... I wouldn't mind raising it with you once it hatches. Would you like that?&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'd be worried with how both of our schedules are usually so busy, we'd hardly have the time to give it attention. But if we can make it work, I'd love that.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}You raise a good point, but Togepi is so easy to care for that even children can do it. I think we can manage.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Well okay, I just wanna make sure it would be properly taken care of.</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 4.png" font-size="small">{cynthia}I've only remembered just now, but we do sound a bit alike, don't we? If I adopted your speech mannerisms, then our speech might become indistinguishable from each other.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ah, huh... Now that you mention it, we do sound a little alike. I mean, all I would need is your confidence to sound more like you!</state>
                <state img="#-DawnThia 3.png" dialogue-layer="over" font-size="smaller">{cynthia}I'm supposed to have a meeting first thing tomorrow, but I guess I'll just call in sick. I'm not ready to leave your side just yet.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Oh, but, I wouldn't be upset if you needed to be somewhere! You still have a job to do after all. I'm still a student, just focusing on my studies.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}It was a bit disingenuous of me to even consider malingering illness for this. Although, I suppose taking the weekends off to be with you would do well to reduce my stress.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}I'm looking forward to those sweet yet fleeting weekends. If only they could last as long as these moments are.</state>

I didn't plan that at all, I totally forgot Mismagius can learn Attract! This is amazing! I can't believe I pulled that off without realizing!&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}In your case, it seems Attract is an ability rather than a learned move, because I felt its effects the minute you walked in here.&lt;br&gt;{dawn}Ahh, Cynthia...

Or maybe even come back here to the Inventory.&lt;br&gt;{cynthia}We could always do both. We've got a lot of time ahead of us to think about it.</state>
