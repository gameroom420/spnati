#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

0-selected=welcome.png,I... am Spooky. You mortals are playing strip poker? I guess that game never gets old.
0-selected=welcome.png,Hey. Does your game need a ghost in it? Of course it does. That's what I'm here for.
0-selected=welcome.png,I... am Spooky. I'm here to show you some amazing things you didn't know ghosts could do.
0-selected,count-role;other&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Threeway=uninterested.png,I dunno, I came here to find some <i>living</i> partners... Maybe if we can arrange a three-way...
0-game_start=welcome.png,I... am Spooky. You mortals are playing strip poker? I guess that game never gets old.

0-game_start=welcome.png,I... am Spooky. And you are...?
0-game_start=annoyed.png,The name is Spooky. Spoo<i>ky</i>. There is only one P. Got it?
0-game_start=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I can't wait to not have a bath at all because I'm a ghost. Fun.
0-game_start=uninterested.png,Hope you weren't expecting some <i>hot and wild</i> ghost action, because spoilers, I can't get wet. Not with regular water, anyway.
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;kamina:=uninterested.png,Geez, are <i>trying</i> to wake the dead?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;ini:=interested.png,Huh. People aren't usually so happy to see ghosts. It's... kind of nice.
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;polly:,marker:Polly_HowDie=strip.png,I'd... rather not talk about how I died...
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;kamina&saying;wait:=calm.png,Nope. I have no idea who you are.

0-game_start,count-role;other&character;galatea:=interested.png,Ooh, a living statue. Closest thing to that I have in my mansion is a man-sized puppet.
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;croix:=interested.png,You're a researcher, huh? I could use more of those.
0-game_start,count-role;opp&character;spooky:2-4,count-role;other&character;spooky:=shocked.png,Wait, <i>me</i>? How's that possible?

0-game_start,count-role;opp&character;spooky:2-4,count-role;other&character;spooky:=shocked.png,Is that <i>me</i>? Did I just discover a new ability of mine?
0-game_start,count-role;opp&character;spooky:2-4,count-role;other&character;spooky:=horny.png,Is that <i>me</i>?... Well, if you're dead for long enough, you'll try anything...
0-game_start,priority:51,count-exposed&role;other&var;:=happy.png,Ha! This'll be easy. You mortals are so moronic, ~other~ couldn't even get dressed right!

0-game_start,count-female:1=happy.png,I'm the only woman here, huh? How fortunate.
0-game_start,count-male:0=calm.png,Oh. I was hoping there would be some men playing. Oh well. Ghosts don't have room to be picky.
0-game_start,count-male:0=calm.png,Oh. I was hoping there would be some men playing. Oh well. I've learned to make do without them.
0-game_start,priority:51,count-naked&role;other&var;:=calm.png,You've got a lot of guts showing up here naked, ~other~. I like that.
0-game_start,test:~background.exhibition~:true=horny.png,Ooh, I'm going to have fun watching you mortals embarrass yourselves in front of all these people.
0-game_start,test:~background.exhibition~:true=shocked.png,Ah! Shoot! Ghosts aren't supposed to be seen by a lot of people at once!
0-game_start,test:~background~:alley=innocent.png,Wow, this place is pretty gross. Good thing I'm completely unaffected by it.
0-game_start,test:~background~:alley=innocent.png,This place is pretty gross, huh? Good thing I'm floating, and incorporeal, and have no sense of smell.
0-game_start,test:~background~:alley=happy.png,Oh, gee, is that broken glass? Have fun with that, mortals.
0-game_start,test:~background~:alley=interested.png,Wow, stripping in a dark, dirty alley? You mortals are so depraved.
0-game_start,test:~background~:alley=calm.png,All the broken glass reminds me of home... What? Oh, nothing.
0-game_start,test:~background~:arcade=calm.png,These arcade machines are fine enough, but I prefer my custom ones. <i>Much</i> more fun.
0-game_start,test:~background~:armory=interested.png,Ooh, instruments of death. I might take one of those home...
0-game_start,test:~background~:armory=uninterested.png,Hey, just a heads-up, if one of those weapons starts floating, that's not me. My reach is as normal as yours.
0-game_start,test:~background~:bathhouse=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I can't wait to not have a bath at all because I'm a ghost. Fun.

0-game_start,test:~background~:beach=shocked.png,Ouh, geez, the sun is so bright...
0-game_start,test:~background~:beach=shocked.png,Ouh, geez, the sun is so bright. It hurts my... ghost eyes.
0-game_start,test:~background~:beach=shocked.png,Have fun with sand in your clothes, mortals. I'll be here... adjusting to how bright it is... Guh...
0-game_start,test:~background~:beach=shocked.png,Have fun getting sun-burnt, mortals. I'll be here, completely fine... <i>Damn, I should've brought sunglassess...</i>
0-game_start,test:~background~:haunted forest=annoyed.png,Before you ask, no, I do <i>not</i> know any of the ghosts here.
0-game_start,test:~background~:haunted forest=annoyed.png,Before you ask, no, I do <i>not</i> live here. I live in a nice mansion on a hill.
0-game_start,test:~background~:hot spring=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I can't wait to not have a bath at all because I'm a ghost. Fun.
0-game_start,test:~background~:hot spring=uninterested.png,Hope you weren't expecting some <i>hot and wild</i> ghost action, because spoilers, I can't get wet. Not with regular water, anyway.
0-game_start,test:~background~:mansion=calm.png,Huh. This place is nice, I guess, but I prefer my own mansion.
0-game_start,test:~background~:mansion=calm.png,This is a nice mansion, I suppose, but I'd bet mine is bigger.
0-game_start,test:~background~:mansion=interested.png,This is a nice place, I guess, but my mansion's better. It's got all kinds of different themed rooms. I think there's even a restaurant in there somewhere...
0-game_start,test:~background~:showers=innocent.png,Did you know that running water makes ghosts more powerful? People think that's limited to rivers and streams, but nope, sinks and baths too.
0-game_start,test:~background~:showers=innocent.png,I may not be able to shower, but at least all this running water makes me more powerful. Oh? Did you think that meant rivers and streams? Nope. Plumbing too.

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=interested.png,You know what? I'll take ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm.png,Hey, you can have these ~cards~.
swap_cards=calm.png,You can take these ~cards~ cards back.
swap_cards=annoyed.png,Take these ~cards~ back, foolish dealer.
swap_cards=interested.png,I'll take, uh... ~cards~, I guess.

0-good_hand=interested.png,Oh, would you look at that. I got something really good.
0-okay_hand=interested.png,Huh? Well, these will have to do.
0-okay_hand=calm.png,Well this could be better.
0-okay_hand=calm.png,This should be enough.
0-okay_hand=interested.png,Hmm. Okay then.
0-okay_hand=interested.png,A pair's not bad, right?
0-bad_hand=annoyed.png,How <i>dare</i> you give me these cards.
0-bad_hand=sad.png,You know what? Let's just pretend this isn't my hand.

0-hand,count-role;other&character;aella&sayingmarker;AellaBookClub:=happy.png,I recently started reading some of Stephen King's work. I find it... oddly relatable.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;croix&stage;0&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;nefarious:=calm.png,Oh well. Not <i>everything</i> you research needs to be nefarious. Sometimes you just need to... research arcade cabinets, or whatever.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;3:=excited.png,Ooh, sounds like you have a secret to reveal.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=calm.png,Say, if you're such a fan of spiders, you should come visit my mansion.

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;5:=calm.png,Well then? Let's see it.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=interested.png,What did you have in mind?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=interested.png,What's it like, having arms made of ribbons? Do you even have a sense of touch?

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&stage;0:=calm.png,You know, our jobs aren't that different. We make our opponents do battle with our monsters. The only difference is your opponents get back up when you're done.

#finished
-1-male_must_strip=calm.png,This game's still going. Hop to it, ~name~.
-1-male_must_strip=happy.png,Well? I may be done, but I still want a good show.
-1-male_must_strip=innocent.png,Don't forget, ~name~, it's never too late to disappoint me, so choose wisely.
-1-male_must_strip=calm.png,You'll find the dead are quite persistent. Now strip.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,About time. That schtick was starting to become older than me, <i>and I'm over fifty.</i>
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Aw, come on. Your bits are flapping in the wind. <i>How do you still have hope that you'll win?</i>
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:=calm.png,I'm serious, you should really drop the act. I can't even count how many "protagonists" have died in my mansion, thinking they'll defeat me or solve some mystery or something.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Listen, buddy, I've seen a lot of guys like you in my time. You know where they always end up? In a pit of spikes. So cool it with the motivational speechs and boisterousness, okay?
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Let me give you a piece of advice, Kamina: in my experience, swagger gets you nowhere. Well, more like it gets you into a pit of spikes. So cut it out, okay?
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;0:=uninterested.png,News flash, buddy, <i>everyone</i> thinks they're the protagonist, up until they find themselves lost in my mansion, if they don't rush forward into a trap door leading to a spike pit first.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=interested.png,Oh, are you a relative of Tirsiak's? You don't have antlers, though...
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;link&stage;4:=interested.png,Oh, so you <i>can</i> talk.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;kokichi&stage;0:=interested.png,What's with the getup? You the proud owner of a yacht or something?

-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:=interested.png,A genie...? I suppose that's magical enough to be okay. Not really dead or mosterous enough, but you're fine.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;aimee&stage;0:=excited.png,Alright! Cowgirl's opening fire!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;2:=calm.png,Alright. I'll bite. Let's see this trick.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&sayingmarker;bracelets:=calm.png,Are you sure about that? People have never needed some kind of artifact to speak to me.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;5:=excited.png,Finally, we get to see your face! And everything else we were supposed to be seeing before!
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;5:=horny.png,Gee, if you were taking your shirt off any faster, you'd be ripping it... Say...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=annoyed.png,Ha, like I haven't seen one of <i>those</i> before.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;6:=uninterested.png,Hurray. Moon lost again. I'm so happy.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;6:=uninterested.png,Great. It's Moon's turn. Whoopty doo.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;1:=calm.png,I wonder, how does your boss feel about online flash being a dying medium?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;0:=interested.png,I've always wondered what it'd look like if Specimen 1 had a baby with a human. I guess they'd look like you; a box with limbs.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=interested.png,A secret, huh? Don't worry, I've got no one to tell. All of my friends are dead.

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=calm.png,Since you've already shown off a lot, I'm going to let your accessories slide.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,id:10=interested.png,So, are the burns tender, or are they numb? On the one hand, tenderness means more pain, but on the other, not feeling pain at all can be just as bad.

0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.

0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=calm.png,Besides, it looks like you don't have much left to take off anyway.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;1:=calm.png,But now you have no room to complain when I use my knife as a buffer.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=sad.png,Cat ears? That's all you were hiding? That's not a very juicy secret.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=sad.png,Oh. You were just hiding cat ears? That's not very exciting.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=calm.png,Challenge accepted.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:=interested.png,Gee, you seem real upset for losing what's supposedly an insignificant item.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=excited.png,Hey, Vriska's finally showing some skin!
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,id:11=distracted.png,How far down do your burns go? Don't worry, if you don't want to tell us, you can just <i>show</i> us.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Huh. You look like some kind of tacky superhero.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;1:,id:41=annoyed.png,I don't care about other people's monsters, but I'm not letting you anywhere <i>near</i> mine. I can't believe I'm saying this, but <i>stay away from my mansion.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=calm.png,Looks like something some edgy teen would've designed.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=calm.png,Nice Halloween costume.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:=calm.png,Odd. I once found a sweater just like that lying next to one of my tentacle monsters...
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=innocent.png,Oh good, I've been looking for a maid. Why don't you come over and clean my mansion?
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate... for you, anyway. This doesn't negatively affect me in any way.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=interested.png,Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that you wanted to earn <i>a lot</i> of money and aren't afaid to shoot a few... "wild animals." Seemed like it'd be a no-brainer for you.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=uninterested.png,Oh, you came back... Great..

1-male_removing_accessory=innocent.png,Getting desperate, huh? That's too bad.
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,Well, I guess you can't give it all away too quickly.
1-male_removing_accessory=interested.png,Your ~clothing~, huh? Makes sense, I guess.
1-male_removing_accessory=calm.png,I guess your ~clothing~ had to come off eventually. Why not now?
1-male_removing_accessory=uninterested.png,I guess not everyone wants to show off right away.
1-male_removing_accessory=happy.png,Fine, fine. Take off your ~clothing~. It won't save you from humiliation, I'm sure.

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=interested.png,A secret, huh? Don't worry, I've got no one to tell. All of my friends are dead.

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Couldn't have gone with red, or green, or good ol' black. Had to be yellow, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Huh. Must have finally realized how terrifying I am.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=happy.png,I didn't think you would be. You should come over to my mansion sometime. You'd be rich of you make it to the end. I'm sure it'll be easy for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=innocent.png,I knew it. Anything that claims to let you speak to the dead is always a hoax.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=interested.png,I know ugly when I see it -- my mansion's full of ugly monsters -- and <i>those</i> shoes make Specimen 10 look like a big, lovely smile. I mean <i>wow</i>!

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Of course I know you're just a human <i>wearing</i> a box, I was just saying...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=calm.png,Since you've already shown off a lot, I'm going to let your accessories slide.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,id:10=interested.png,So, are the burns tender, or are they numb? On the one hand, tenderness means more pain, but on the other, not feeling pain at all can be just as bad.

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=interested.png,This must be the only piece of clothing you're wearing that you don't hate, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wait what?
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the--?

1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wha--? You can take those off? I thought they were bolted on or something.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Your ring...? Well, I guess I did do the same thing with my knife...

1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=sad.png,Cat ears? That's all you were hiding? That's not a very juicy secret.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=sad.png,Oh. You were just hiding cat ears? That's not very exciting.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=calm.png,Challenge accepted.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:=interested.png,Gee, you seem real upset for losing what's supposedly an insignificant item.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=excited.png,Hey, Vriska's finally showing some skin!
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,id:11=distracted.png,How far down do your burns go? Don't worry, if you don't want to tell us, you can just <i>show</i> us.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Huh. You look like some kind of tacky superhero.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;1:,id:41=annoyed.png,I don't care about other people's monsters, but I'm not letting you anywhere <i>near</i> mine. I can't believe I'm saying this, but <i>stay away from my mansion.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=calm.png,Looks like something some edgy teen would've designed.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=calm.png,Nice Halloween costume.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:=calm.png,Odd. I once found a sweater just like that lying next to one of my tentacle monsters...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=innocent.png,Oh good, I've been looking for a maid. Why don't you come over and clean my mansion?
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate... for you, anyway. This doesn't negatively affect me in any way.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=interested.png,Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that you wanted to earn <i>a lot</i> of money and aren't afaid to shoot a few... "wild animals." Seemed like it'd be a no-brainer for you.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=uninterested.png,Oh, you came back... Great..
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I'm here with barely anything on while Vriska has all the clothes in the world.

2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wha--? You can take those off? I thought they were bolted on or something.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Your ring...? Well, I guess I did do the same thing with my knife... and when I conjured underwear...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,count-role;other&character;saki_zls:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,I know that Saki is undead too. Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,That's all, huh? Well, I can't complain, considering your situation.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=innocent.png,Getting desperate, huh? That's too bad.
2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,If you hadn't noticed, I'm not even wearing shoes.
2-female_removed_accessory=sad.png,I remember when I had my very own ~clothing~.
2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,Now lose something better.
2-female_removed_accessory=uninterested.png,You'd better lose something better next time.
2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,<i>I'm</i> the one who's supposed to be doing the teasing.
2-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,You <i>will</i> remove something better next time.
2-female_removed_accessory=uninterested.png,Give us something better next time and maybe I'll forgive you.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Well, that outfit is... something.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=calm.png,Besides, it looks like you don't have much left to take off anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=calm.png,Challenge accepted.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:=interested.png,Gee, you seem real upset for losing what's supposedly an insignificant item.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=excited.png,Hey, Vriska's finally showing some skin!
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,id:11=distracted.png,How far down do your burns go? Don't worry, if you don't want to tell us, you can just <i>show</i> us.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Huh. You look like some kind of tacky superhero.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;1:,id:41=annoyed.png,I don't care about other people's monsters, but I'm not letting you anywhere <i>near</i> mine. I can't believe I'm saying this, but <i>stay away from my mansion.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=calm.png,Looks like something some edgy teen would've designed.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=calm.png,Nice Halloween costume.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:=calm.png,Odd. I once found a sweater just like that lying next to one of my tentacle monsters...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=innocent.png,Oh good, I've been looking for a maid. Why don't you come over and clean my mansion?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate... for you, anyway. This doesn't negatively affect me in any way.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=interested.png,Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that you wanted to earn <i>a lot</i> of money and aren't afaid to shoot a few... "wild animals." Seemed like it'd be a no-brainer for you.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=uninterested.png,Oh, you came back... Great..
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I'm here with barely anything on while Vriska has all the clothes in the world.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=horny.png,Ooh, that's nice. Maybe we'll even get a nip slip?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1&saying;prosthetic:,marker:EmiLegs=interested.png,Prosthetic, huh? I bet you look real freaky without them, don't you?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=interested.png,Say, what would happen if we were to try to trim some of the extra ribbon at the top of your arms? Would it hurt? Would they grow back?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;1:=calm.png,See? I'm not just a jerk, anyone would do what I did.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:=happy.png,Seriously, "crocs" is too cool of a name for them. They should be called "blob fishes" or something.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Cat ears? You kept your ribbon this long just to hide that?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Have you <i>seen</i> the kinds of things that roam around my mansion?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=happy.png,Well, whatever. It's not like you're the only one playing that way, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Well, whatever. You're out of items now, so it doesn't really matter.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1:=calm.png,Whatever. As long as they come off next, it won't matter.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=shocked.png,Whoa, fake out. No fair.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;1:=happy.png,Why are you wearing that box anyway? Ashamed of your appearance? Are you ugly under there?
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, it's nice not having a need for warm legs.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:,count-role;other&character;marinette:=uninterested.png,Great. Like we needed <i>two</i> tacky superheroes here...
2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Couldn't have gone with red, or green, or good ol' black. Had to be yellow, huh?

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=happy.png,I didn't think you would be. You should come over to my mansion sometime. You'd be rich of you make it to the end. I'm sure it'll be easy for you.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=innocent.png,I knew it. Anything that claims to let you speak to the dead is always a hoax.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=uninterested.png,No stabbing attempts this time? How disappointing.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=calm.png,Since you've already shown off a lot, I'm going to let your accessories slide.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,id:10=interested.png,So, are the burns tender, or are they numb? On the one hand, tenderness means more pain, but on the other, not feeling pain at all can be just as bad.

3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How many sides did you say that die has again...?
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.

-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:=calm.png,"Nonsense! This is how a manly man does things!" you're probably thinking. Well guess what? Manly points don't save people from death. In fact, it might make some of my specimen want to kill you <i>more</i>.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-3-male_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,I have a draft going <i>through</i> me, and that's all you're taking off?
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,Hmph. I had you pegged for a coward, ~name~.
-3-female_removing_accessory=uninterested.png,You must think you're <i>real</i> clever, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,How very brave of you. Not from what your taking off, but who you're upsetting in the process.
-3-female_removing_accessory=bored.png,I'm so excited, I think I might... <i>yawn</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=uninterested.png,... They <i>what</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=interested.png,A secret, huh? Don't worry, the dead are good at keeping secrets.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=interested.png,A secret, huh? Don't worry, I've got no one to tell. All of my friends are dead.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=horny.png,Aw yeah, take it off.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Couldn't have gone with red, or green, or good ol' black. Had to be yellow, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Huh. Must have finally realized how terrifying I am.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=happy.png,I didn't think you would be. You should come over to my mansion sometime. You'd be rich of you make it to the end. I'm sure it'll be easy for you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=innocent.png,I knew it. Anything that claims to let you speak to the dead is always a hoax.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=interested.png,I know ugly when I see it -- my mansion's full of ugly monsters -- and <i>those</i> shoes make Specimen 10 look like a big, lovely smile. I mean <i>wow</i>!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,I think you're right.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=uninterested.png,No stabbing attempts this time? How disappointing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Of course I know you're just a human <i>wearing</i> a box, I was just saying...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=calm.png,Since you've already shown off a lot, I'm going to let your accessories slide.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,id:10=interested.png,So, are the burns tender, or are they numb? On the one hand, tenderness means more pain, but on the other, not feeling pain at all can be just as bad.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=uninterested.png,So, are you going to tell us what the possible outcomes are, or...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=horny.png,Come on, naked outcome!
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,And the winner is...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,From one outfit to another...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=horny.png,Say, which number leaves you in nothing but panties?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How many sides did you say that die has again...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=interested.png,This must be the only piece of clothing you're wearing that you don't hate, huh?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wait what?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the--?
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;0:,id:28=uninterested.png,Wait, you kill <i>monsters</i>? I... kinda need those. I don't care how good of a killer you are, I can't have you killing my monsters.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wha--? You can take those off? I thought they were bolted on or something.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Your ring...? Well, I guess I did do the same thing with my knife... and when I conjured underwear...
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,count-role;other&character;saki_zls:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,I know that Saki is undead too. Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=happy.png,That's all, huh? Well, I can't complain, considering your situation.
-3-female_removing_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=innocent.png,Getting desperate, huh? That's too bad.
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,I know you've got some better stuff under there.
-3-female_removed_accessory=uninterested.png,You remember what game you're playing, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed.png,You think you're clever, don't you?
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,This would make a very... interesting cause of death, don't you think?... Don't know what I'm talking about? Well, don't worry about it.
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Well, this makes my job a bit easier... Oh, never mind what I mean...
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm.png,Well, that outfit is... something.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6:=calm.png,Challenge accepted.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=uninterested.png,Even if I might lose because of you...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:=interested.png,Gee, you seem real upset for losing what's supposedly an insignificant item.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=excited.png,Hey, Vriska's finally showing some skin!
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,id:11=distracted.png,How far down do your burns go? Don't worry, if you don't want to tell us, you can just <i>show</i> us.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Huh. You look like some kind of tacky superhero.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;1:,id:41=annoyed.png,I don't care about other people's monsters, but I'm not letting you anywhere <i>near</i> mine. I can't believe I'm saying this, but <i>stay away from my mansion.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=calm.png,Looks like something some edgy teen would've designed.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=calm.png,Nice Halloween costume.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:=calm.png,Odd. I once found a sweater just like that lying next to one of my tentacle monsters...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=innocent.png,Oh good, I've been looking for a maid. Why don't you come over and clean my mansion?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate... for you, anyway. This doesn't negatively affect me in any way.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=interested.png,Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that you wanted to earn <i>a lot</i> of money and aren't afaid to shoot a few... "wild animals." Seemed like it'd be a no-brainer for you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=uninterested.png,Oh, you came back... Great..
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I'm here with nothing on while Vriska has all the clothes in the world.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=horny.png,Ooh, that's nice. Maybe we'll even get a nip slip?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1&saying;prosthetic:,marker:EmiLegs=interested.png,Prosthetic, huh? I bet you look real freaky without them, don't you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=interested.png,Say, what would happen if we were to try to trim some of the extra ribbon at the top of your arms? Would it hurt? Would they grow back?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;1:=calm.png,See? I'm not just a jerk, anyone would do what I did.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:=happy.png,Seriously, "crocs" is too cool of a name for them. They should be called "blob fishes" or something.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Cat ears? You kept your ribbon this long just to hide that?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Have you <i>seen</i> the kinds of things that roam around my mansion?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=happy.png,Well, whatever. It's not like you're the only one playing that way, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Well, whatever. You're out of items now, so it doesn't really matter.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1:=calm.png,Whatever. As long as they come off next, it won't matter.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=shocked.png,Whoa, fake out. No fair.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;1:=happy.png,Why are you wearing that box anyway? Ashamed of your appearance? Are you ugly under there?
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, it's nice not having a need for warm legs.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:,count-role;other&character;marinette:=uninterested.png,Great. Like we needed <i>two</i> tacky superheroes here...
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-exposed&role;target:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c,targetNotSaidMarker:1c=calm.png,Well, that outfit is... something.

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Cat ears? You kept your ribbon this long just to hide that?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;6:=annoyed.png,That's it? Have you <i>seen</i> the kinds of things that roam around my mansion?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=calm.png,There's only so long you can stall like that, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&layers;3-4:=innocent.png,I think at this point, your fate is already sealed.

-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;2:=happy.png,Well, whatever. It's not like you're the only one playing that way, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;6&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Well, whatever. You're out of items now, so it doesn't really matter.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1:=calm.png,Whatever. As long as they come off next, it won't matter.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=shocked.png,Whoa, fake out. No fair.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;1:=happy.png,Why are you wearing that box anyway? Ashamed of your appearance? Are you ugly under there?
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=calm.png,You know, it's nice not having a need for warm legs.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:,count-role;other&character;marinette:=uninterested.png,Great. Like we needed <i>two</i> tacky superheroes here...

-1-male_removed_accessory=sad.png,Why is anything that small even allowed in the game?
-1-male_removed_accessory=uninterested.png,Seriously, I could masturbate again if I wanted to, but you're not doing much to make that so.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:=calm.png,"Nonsense! This is how a manly man does things!" you're probably thinking. That's what they all say, right before they blindly rush forward, straight into one of my traps.
-1-male_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;1:=calm.png,"Nonsense! This is how a manly man does things!" you're probably thinking. Well guess what? Manly points don't save people from death. If you get cut in half, you'll die, no matter how manly you are.

-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;blake&stage;5:=interested.png,A secret, huh? Don't worry, I've got no one to tell. All of my friends are dead.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=horny.png,Aw yeah, take it off.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Couldn't have gone with red, or green, or good ol' black. Had to be yellow, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=happy.png,Huh. Must have finally realized how terrifying I am.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;0:=happy.png,I didn't think you would be. You should come over to my mansion sometime. You'd be rich of you make it to the end. I'm sure it'll be easy for you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;0&saidmarker;bracelets:=innocent.png,I knew it. Anything that claims to let you speak to the dead is always a hoax.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;0:=interested.png,I know ugly when I see it -- my mansion's full of ugly monsters -- and <i>those</i> shoes make Specimen 10 look like a big, lovely smile. I mean <i>wow</i>!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5:=calm.png,I think you're right.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;5&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=uninterested.png,No stabbing attempts this time? How disappointing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;myriam&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Of course I know you're just a human <i>wearing</i> a box, I was just saying...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;4:=calm.png,Since you've already shown off a lot, I'm going to let your accessories slide.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;0:,id:10=interested.png,So, are the burns tender, or are they numb? On the one hand, tenderness means more pain, but on the other, not feeling pain at all can be just as bad.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=uninterested.png,So, are you going to tell us what the possible outcomes are, or...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=horny.png,Come on, naked outcome!
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,And the winner is...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,From one outfit to another...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=horny.png,Say, which number leaves you in nothing but panties?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=interested.png,How many sides did you say that die has again...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1-3:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=interested.png,This must be the only piece of clothing you're wearing that you don't hate, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wait what?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the--?
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;0:,id:28=uninterested.png,Wait, you kill <i>monsters</i>? I... kinda need those. I don't care how good of a killer you are, I can't have you killing my monsters.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;0:=shocked.png,Wha--? You can take those off? I thought they were bolted on or something.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;0:=uninterested.png,Your ring...? Well, I guess I did do the same thing with my knife... and when I conjured underwear...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sakura&stage;0:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS1:,count-role;other&character;saki_zls:,marker:ZLS1=happy.png,I know that Saki is undead too. Did you really think I wouldn't know? Death's my business.

-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;5:=calm.png,Besides, it looks like you don't have much left to take off anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;meia:=interested.png,Gee, you seem real upset for losing what's supposedly an insignificant item.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4b:=excited.png,Hey, Vriska's finally showing some skin!
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;1:,id:11=distracted.png,How far down do your burns go? Don't worry, if you don't want to tell us, you can just <i>show</i> us.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4a:=calm.png,Huh. You look like some kind of tacky superhero.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;chara_dreemurr&stage;1:,id:41=annoyed.png,I don't care about other people's monsters, but I'm not letting you anywhere <i>near</i> mine. I can't believe I'm saying this, but <i>stay away from my mansion.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3a:=calm.png,Looks like something some edgy teen would've designed.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2a:=calm.png,Nice Halloween costume.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;3&saidmarker;3b:=calm.png,Odd. I once found a sweater just like that lying next to one of my tentacle monsters...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;2&saidmarker;2b:=innocent.png,Oh good, I've been looking for a maid. Why don't you come over and clean my mansion?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ini&stage;2:=happy.png,Oh no. That's unfortunate... for you, anyway. This doesn't negatively affect me in any way.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;revy&stage;1:=interested.png,Oh, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that you wanted to earn <i>a lot</i> of money and aren't afaid to shoot a few... "wild animals." Seemed like it'd be a no-brainer for you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;fled:=uninterested.png,Oh, you came back... Great..
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;1:=uninterested.png,Oh. Great. I'm here with nothing on while Vriska has all the clothes in the world.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;4&saidmarker;4c:=horny.png,Ooh, that's nice. Maybe we'll even get a nip slip?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;1&saying;prosthetic:,marker:EmiLegs=interested.png,Prosthetic, huh? I bet you look real freaky without them, don't you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;ribbon_girl&stage;1:=interested.png,Say, what would happen if we were to try to trim some of the extra ribbon at the top of your arms? Would it hurt? Would they grow back?
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;galatea&stage;1:=calm.png,See? I'm not just a jerk, anyone would do what I did.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;1:=happy.png,Seriously, "crocs" is too cool of a name for them. They should be called "blob fishes" or something.

0-male_removing_minor,count-not_decent&role;target:=calm.png,Eh, I'll allow it. ~clothing.ifPlural(Those are|That's)~ only in the way, anyway.
0-male_removing_minor,count-not_decent&role;target:=horny.png,That's it, give us a better look at your soft flesh...
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kamina&stage;2:=calm.png,Besides, things only get fun once you lose hope, and types like you don't give up that easily.
0-male_removed_minor,count-not_decent&role;target:=happy.png,Feeling better? You sure do <i>look</i> better.
0-male_removed_minor,count-not_decent&role;target:=happy.png,You look so much better without ~clothing.ifPlural(those stupid things|that stupid thing)~ in the way.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;bernadetta&stage;0:=innocent.png,Do you like spiders? I like spiders, especially <i>big</i> spiders. Spiders tend to get fuzzier as you go up in size, and their chelicerae get stronger too, giving them better bites.

0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee:=innocent.png,I'm glad I don't have to worry about the bullets hitting me.

0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee:=innocent.png,Sure is nice being incorporeal, especially during this particular moment.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,Waiting is the only part about this I don't like.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;amy&stage;0:=happy.png,My mansion has a lot of rooms, so spiders are pretty inevitable. Can't get rid of them, even. It's basically a problem.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:=happy.png,Nothing sheds off the pounds like being deprived of food and chased around by deadly monsters.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;shantae&stage;0:,id:31=uninterested.png,Oh, you're only <i>half</i> genie?... Well, I guess as long as you're magical at all, you're not so bad. And at least you know how to move your hips...
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;gwen:=calm.png,Time to see what you're wearing under that suit.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;5:=innocent.png,Too bad you weren't more careless. You could've been a ghost detective.

0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=calm.png,Eh. I've seen worse.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;kyoko&stage;6:=calm.png,That's not even the worse injury I've seen.

0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:14=uninterested.png,I mean, why spend so much time hiding your fake legs anyway? Everybody knows normal is boring.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;1:=happy.png,I might whip something custom up for you, if you play your cards right - or should I say, <i>wrong</i>.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=calm.png,Oh no. I'm really scared of you now. You can see just how scared I am by the expression on my face.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=calm.png,Face paint? How terrifying. I'm shaking in my boots.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;sonya:=calm.png,Oh no. Not face paint... My one and only fear... Ha.

0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;rin&stage;1:=happy.png,Say, your legs must be <i>extra</i> important to you because of that, huh? That must make the threat of someone breaking your legs even more threatening.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=happy.png,Nice underwear. Do you wear that every day?

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,That's not fair! I only came here with two items <i>total</i>!
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=happy.png,Too bad for you, petty mortal, you have to go barefoot. Sure is nice being able to float here, not stepping foot on the cold floor.

0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=calm.png,Well, I guess we know what Vriska does on the weekends.

1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Hey, what gives? I was promised a spider girl, not some regular mortal.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=interested.png,Hey, you don't look half bad in that.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;support:=interested.png,Huh. I don't suppose the same applies to ghosts, does it?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=interested.png,Huh. Well, that didn't expose much, but it sure was... something, at least.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,I could make my clothes transparent too, but that would, uh... take too much ghost energy
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,My clothes could be transparent too, but, uh... your eyes wouldn't have been able to handle looking at me.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:16=annoyed.png,I didn't come here wearing a lot, you know. And ghosts can't dismember themselves, so I can't cheat like you can.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;wicking:=calm.png,I like the second option better.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=innocent.png,I won't -- heh heh -- I won't laugh. Those pants are -- pffft -- those poor pants are seriously hurt now. <i>Heh heh heh...</i> I don't think they're going to make it.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;2:=calm.png,If you come over to my mansion, I might be able to hook you up with a 3D model of your own. It'd be a whole lot nicer than your little cutout animations, don't you think?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,I'm a ghost, Jasmine. Nothing gets by me.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,Nothing gets by the dead, Jasmine.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=calm.png,I'm sure you'll dry off when you roll again.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&stage;1:=calm.png,My job would be a lot easier if I could replicate that technology. It'd make ambushes <i>much</i> easier.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;4:=uninterested.png,Never mind the tears at the bottom of my dress. Those are there because they look cool.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=happy.png,Nice underwear. Do you wear that every day?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=happy.png,Nice underwear. Do you always wear that under your bodysuit?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,No! That shouldn't count for two items! Why should <i>we</i> have to suffer for what <i>you</i> forgot?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=innocent.png,No. Not at all, actually.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Oh sure, you're okay with <i>this</i> but not with me counting my knife? Wonderful.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=calm.png,Oh, your wearing a full set of lingerie, not just the garter belt? Nice.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Oh. Yes. Exactly what I want you to murder: your clothing.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Ah, yes, my favorite kind of murder: <i>clothing murder.</i>
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,That's not fair! I only came here with two items <i>total</i>!
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=happy.png,Too bad for you, petty mortal, you have to go barefoot. Sure is nice being able to float here, not stepping foot on the cold floor.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=calm.png,Well, I guess we know what Vriska does on the weekends.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,What? But how? There was no bulge.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=interested.png,You don't say.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=happy.png,Looks like you're already overheating there. I sure am glad I can't feel the heat.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=calm.png,You might be surprised how few people play like you do, Pinkie.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;appropriate:=calm.png,You think?
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;4:,id:12=interested.png,Your burn patterns are interesting. They don't look natural at all. It's almost like you drew them on or something.
1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;6:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ZLS2:,id:6=uninterested.png,Wait, we're... not going to count this too, are we?... We are?... Great...

2-male_removing_major=calm.png,Well, I took off my dress, so why not take off your ~clothing~?

2-male_removed_major=interested.png,Must be pretty chilly now, huh? I wouldn't know.
2-male_removed_major=happy.png,Great thing about being a ghost is that you don't get colder when you take off your clothes.

2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:19=happy.png,Oh no. Your poor, flimsy mortal shirt. Ghost clothes never break, if you didn't know. It's pretty great.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=horny.png,Oh, I'm not complaining.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=horny.png,Ooh, good first choice.

2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=uninterested.png,Well unless your "trick" is better than taking off your shirt, I don't care to see it.
2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Whoa. That's quite a violent possession going on there.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=calm.png,A garter belt, huh? Classy.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=calm.png,At least Eridan has good taste in leggings.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,Aw, it flew away. I wanted to catch it and bring it back to my mansion.

2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Hey, you can't count that as two! I can't apparate any more clothes to keep up!
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Okay, I know I apparated underwear, but I <i>had to.</i> You don't need your jump suit to be two pieces!

3-female_removed_major=happy.png,Feeling a bit... cold?
3-female_removed_major=happy.png,Cold? Too bad.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=interested.png,... You okay there?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=interested.png,... I think she died. Cool.

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=shocked.png,Your clothes... They just... vanished.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=calm.png,A garter belt, huh? Classy.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=calm.png,At least Eridan has good taste in leggings.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,Aw, it flew away. I wanted to catch it and bring it back to my mansion.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:=sad.png,Aw, that's it? I've seen worse. Much, <i>much</i> worse.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:=sad.png,That's it? I've seen worse - I've <i>caused</i> worse, even.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aw... Well, I guess that's fair.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;appropriate:=uninterested.png,Gee, really? I hadn't noticed.

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Hey, what gives? I was promised a spider girl, not some regular mortal.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Hey, you can't count that as two! I can't apparate any more clothes to keep up!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=annoyed.png,Okay, I know I apparated underwear, but I <i>had to.</i> You don't need your jump suit to be two pieces!
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=interested.png,Hey, you don't look half bad in that.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;support:=interested.png,Huh. I don't suppose the same applies to ghosts, does it?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=interested.png,Huh. Well, that didn't expose much, but it sure was... something, at least.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,I could've made my dress transparent too, but, uh... I wanted to keep my underwear a surprise.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:16=annoyed.png,I didn't come here wearing a lot, you know. And ghosts can't dismember themselves, so I can't cheat like you can.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;wicking:=calm.png,I like the second option better.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=innocent.png,I won't -- heh heh -- I won't laugh. Those pants are -- pffft -- those poor pants are seriously hurt now. <i>Heh heh heh...</i> I don't think they're going to make it.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;2:=calm.png,If you come over to my mansion, I might be able to hook you up with a 3D model of your own. It'd be a whole lot nicer than your little cutout animations, don't you think?
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,I'm a ghost, Jasmine. Nothing gets by me.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,Nothing gets by the dead, Jasmine.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=calm.png,I'm sure you'll dry off when you roll again.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&stage;1:=calm.png,My job would be a lot easier if I could replicate that technology. It'd make ambushes <i>much</i> easier.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,No! That shouldn't count for two items! Why should <i>we</i> have to suffer for what <i>you</i> forgot?

3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Oh sure, you're okay with <i>this</i> but not with me counting my knife? Wonderful.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=uninterested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? I could've apparated a nicer set of underwear, if I felt like it...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=uninterested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? I could've apparated a set like that, if I felt like it...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? Makes me think I should've apparated a nicer set of underwear...
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Oh. Yes. Exactly what I want you to murder: your clothing.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Ah, yes, my favorite kind of murder: <i>clothing murder.</i>
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,That's not fair! I only came here with two items!... I mean before I apparated more.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=happy.png,Too bad for you, petty mortal, you have to go barefoot. Sure is nice being able to float here, not stepping foot on the cold floor.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=calm.png,Well, I guess we know what Vriska does on the weekends.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,What? But how? There was no bulge.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=interested.png,You don't say.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=happy.png,Looks like you're already overheating there. I sure am glad I can't feel the heat.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=calm.png,You might be surprised how few people play like you do, Pinkie.

-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,I hope you'll re-roll if you get the same outfit twice.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;1:=happy.png,Time to see the spider girl's face.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;4:=uninterested.png,Well unless your "trick" is better than taking off your shirt, I don't care to see it.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=shocked.png,Whoa. That's quite a violent possession going on there.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=shocked.png,W-what?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;1:=shocked.png,Whoa!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=calm.png,Yeah, and...?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&stage;0:=interested.png,You keep your monsters in little capsules, right? How does that work?
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;7:,id:15=uninterested.png,You totally were...
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:,count-role;self&saidmarker;ZLS2:=happy.png,I was wondering when you'd take your makeup off too.
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS2:=excited.png,Makeup? Aha! So that's how you're hiding how undead you are!
-2-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;5:,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;ZLS2:=excited.png,Makeup? Aha! So that's how you're hiding how undead you are!
-2-female_removed_major=happy.png,Nice and slow, girl.
-2-female_removed_major=calm.png,Oh yeah... That's nice...
-2-female_removed_major=happy.png,Have you considered wearing nothing under your ~clothing~?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=interested.png,... You okay there?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=interested.png,... I think she died. Cool.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;1:=horny.png,<i>Very</i> good first choice.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=shocked.png,<i>What?</i> How did you do that?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=shocked.png,Whoa! Where did your shirt go? I didn't even see you take it off!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=shocked.png,Your clothes... They just... vanished.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;4:=calm.png,A garter belt, huh? Classy.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5b:=calm.png,At least Eridan has good taste in leggings.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;8:,id:17=happy.png,At least I'm already out, so I can sit back and laugh.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;saki_zls&stage;6:,id:7=happy.png,Aw yeah... That's hot...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2&notsaidmarker;bee_stop:=interested.png,Aw, it flew away. I wanted to catch it and bring it back to my mansion.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:=sad.png,Aw, that's it? I've seen worse. Much, <i>much</i> worse.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misato:=sad.png,That's it? I've seen worse - I've <i>caused</i> worse, even.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;2:=calm.png,Aw... Well, I guess that's fair.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;appropriate:=uninterested.png,Gee, really? I hadn't noticed.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5c:=annoyed.png,Hey, don't knock simple dresses.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,Hey, nice stripes.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,Hey, wait, this shouldn't be allowed! Your boobs were already slipping out of your jumpsuit, so this is barely different!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;april&stage;4:=angry.png,Hey, wait, this shouldn't be allowed! It's not fair!
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;gwen&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Hey, what gives? I was promised a spider girl, not some regular mortal.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6b:=interested.png,Hey, you don't look half bad in that.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;support:=interested.png,Huh. I don't suppose the same applies to ghosts, does it?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;buffy&stage;5:=interested.png,Huh. Well, that didn't expose much, but it sure was... something, at least.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,I could've made my dress transparent too, but, uh... I wanted to keep my underwear a surprise.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;wicking:=calm.png,I like the second option better.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=innocent.png,I won't -- heh heh -- I won't laugh. Those pants are -- pffft -- those poor pants are seriously hurt now. <i>Heh heh heh...</i> I don't think they're going to make it.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;2:=calm.png,If you come over to my mansion, I might be able to hook you up with a 3D model of your own. It'd be a whole lot nicer than your little cutout animations, don't you think?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,I'm a ghost, Jasmine. Nothing gets by me.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;jasmine:=happy.png,Nothing gets by the dead, Jasmine.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;6&saidmarker;6a:=calm.png,I'm sure you'll dry off when you roll again.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&stage;1:=calm.png,My job would be a lot easier if I could replicate that technology. It'd make ambushes <i>much</i> easier.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,No! That shouldn't count for two items! Why should <i>we</i> have to suffer for what <i>you</i> forgot?
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;3:=innocent.png,No. Not at all, actually.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;marinette&stage;2:=uninterested.png,Oh sure, you're okay with <i>this</i> but not with me counting my knife? Wonderful.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=uninterested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? I could've apparated a nicer set of underwear, if I felt like it...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;shego:=uninterested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? I could've apparated a set like that, if I felt like it...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=interested.png,Oh, you're wearing lingerie? Makes me think I should've apparated a nicer set of underwear...
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Oh. Yes. Exactly what I want you to murder: your clothing.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=uninterested.png,Ah, yes, my favorite kind of murder: <i>clothing murder.</i>
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;sayla&stage;4:=angry.png,That's not fair! I only came here with two items!... I mean before I apparated more.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;6:=happy.png,Too bad for you, petty mortal, you have to go barefoot. Sure is nice being able to float here, not stepping foot on the cold floor.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;vriska&stage;5&saidmarker;5a:=calm.png,Well, I guess we know what Vriska does on the weekends.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=shocked.png,What? But how? There was no bulge.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=interested.png,You don't say.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale&saidmarker;warmth:=happy.png,Looks like you're already overheating there. I sure am glad I can't feel the heat.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;1:=calm.png,You might be surprised how few people play like you do, Pinkie.
-2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;hanako&stage;4:,id:12=interested.png,Your burn patterns are interesting. They don't look natural at all. It's almost like you drew them on or something.

-1-male_removed_major,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,So you're wearing panties, huh? Nice.
-1-female_removing_major=calm.png,Well, better late than never.

-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;misato:=excited.png,Any moment now, we'll get to see it!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,And here I thought mortals were cowards.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;zone-tan&stage;1:=happy.png,Goodness knows <i>my</i> higher-ups are doing just fine. Why, I just recently got a 3D model. It looks pretty sexy, if you ask me.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=annoyed.png,How dumb do you think we are, anyway?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;elaine&stage;5:=annoyed.png,How dumb do you think I am? I'm a ghost! Of course I knew there was nothing behind me!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,I could've done that too, you know. I just didn't want to...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;3:=interested.png,Is the clown girl hiding a secret from us?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,No-Bra November, huh? Is that something all mortals follow?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,No-Bra November, huh? I like the sound of that...
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;mary&stage;3:,id:19=happy.png,Oh no. Your poor, flimsy mortal shirt. Ghost clothes never break, if you didn't know. It's pretty great.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;croix&stage;2:=horny.png,Oh, I'm not complaining.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;moon&stage;0:=horny.png,Ooh, good first choice.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=horny.png,Shirt first? I like how you think.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=uninterested.png,So, are you going to tell us what the possible outcomes are, or...?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=horny.png,Come on, naked outcome!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;vriska:=interested.png,And the winner is...

0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could do that too if I wanted to, though.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...

0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? Some of us didn't come here wearing a lot, you know.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
0-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.

0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
0-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care when I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.

0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=welcome.png,Welcome to the land of the dead, Amalia's flowers.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
0-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=happy.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,I normally go without underwear. Not like anyone can tell, anyway.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
0-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=horny.png,Ooh, I think I like this better than actually seeing them.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could do that too if I wanted to, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for counting my knife?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for counting my knife? At least I had my knife when I came in.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care when I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=happy.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,I normally go without underwear. Not like anyone can tell, anyway.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!


#lost dress
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Gonna take ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~ off huh?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Couldn't take how hot and bothered you are by the sight of a ghost's underwear, huh?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Getting too hot and bothered, huh? Must still be thinking about what I showed when I took my dress off.
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=happy.png,I guess you were just so scared by me that you couldn't talk, huh?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, I was staring. So what? What are you gonna do, slap me?
2-male_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Yeah, I guess that's something.
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=sad.png,Great. Even the robot has bigger breasts than me...
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,Hey. Where are your nipples? I feel ripped off...
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,No nipples? That's so... uncanny valley.
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=interested.png,I wonder what happened to give you the courage to speak.
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,Nice tights.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Time to see your penis, then? Nice!
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,Time to see just how much you've been thinking about me naked.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,Impress me and maybe I'll flash you a little something.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,So you don't have nipples, but you do have the main event, right?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,I swear, if you're smooth down there too, someone's going home in pieces.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Whatever. Just strip already.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so I noticed. Shut up and strip already.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,I bet that fits in all sorts of places!
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Hmm... I might be able to make that bigger for you.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,Take it from me, size isn't everything.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Just think about what you saw when I took off my dress and it should get bigger.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=sad.png,... Am I in hell?... Is that what this is? Is that why you all have small penises?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=angry.png,How?! How did I end up in a game with <i>four</i> guys with small dicks?! 
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance2:,marker:PenisChance3=angry.png,Are you kidding me?! <i>You're</i> small too?! This is ridiculous!
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance:,marker:PenisChance2=uninterested.png,Aw come on! Yours is small too?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-not_crotch_visible&male:1-,count-crotch_visible&male:1,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-not_crotch_visible&male:3,count-small_penis:4,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,I bet all the ladies get distracted by that guy. Ahem. Not that I am.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Have you ever gotten a blowjob from a ghost before? All the pleasure of a normal blowjob plus the feel of the air against your skin.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Did you know that ghosts are flexible? Want me to show you why that's great?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Yeah, really anatomically accurate.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Who the heck designed you?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=horny.png,Oh, good. You <i>do</i> have a penis.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could kill someone with that thing. Say...
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could split a girl in half with that. I would know.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=horny.png,Ah, so you have both sets, then? Aren't you a fun toy.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=interested.png,Wow. It must take <i>a lot</i> of blood to get that thing up. I bet you just absolutely <i>gush</i> when you get cut, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,Guess what pretty little things are going to be on display?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ini&sayingmarker;ini_personality:=shocked.png,<i>Whoa.</i>
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=happy.png,As long as they're not mine, sure.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=happy.png,Sure, as long as I'm not the one showing them.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=horny.png,Finally. Take it off nice and slowly for me, Twilight.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs1=uninterested.png,Great, now no one's going to care when I get mine out... Why look at the tiny ghost boobs when the <i>big</i> ghost boobs are already out...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! I knew hiding was pointless!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! Nothing can hide from Spooky!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Ha! Way to go, Winslow!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Hmm... I'm not sure which side I want to win this one...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=interested.png,Huh. I guess it's not a <i>total</i> shame that you're a love fairy.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=calm.png,Huh. Looks like it didn't matter what order you took off your clothes in, since either way, you'd have wound up naked anyway.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Aw, looks like you have to show your breasts now anyway. How sad.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I wouldn't mind either.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=excited.png,Oh good, the bee came back! Quick, someone catch it!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Oh, I'm down with those little ladies.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Hey, mine look just like that. There, now you don't have to keep wondering what they look like.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=horny.png,Ooh, I think I like this better than actually seeing them.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Ooh, I could just sink into those.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,You sure would be fun to possess...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could do that too if I wanted to, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for apparating underwear?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked.png,You could smother someone with those. Say... wanna come by my place later?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,What a killer pair - in more sense than one.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Great, now mine will just look even smaller if I have to show them...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Okay, so they're big, but lets see you do something with them.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,Okay, ~name~, it's time to show us your pride and joy.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care when I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh it's so pretty! I think I can see some wetness down there.
2-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Your submission is inevitable.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=uninterested.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either. Usually...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=uninterested.png,I normally go without underwear anyway. Er, <i>normally</i>.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!


#lost bra
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Show us where you keep your internal organs.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,Show me your chest and I'll show you how you can press it against mine.
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=happy.png,I guess you were just so scared by me that you couldn't talk, huh?
3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, I was staring. So what? What are you gonna do, slap me?
3-male_chest_is_visible=interested.png,Well, you look like you have some endurance.
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=sad.png,Great. Even the robot has bigger breasts than me...
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,Hey. Where are your nipples? I feel ripped off...
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,No nipples? That's so... uncanny valley.
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=interested.png,I wonder what happened to give you the courage to speak.
3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,Nice tights.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=interested.png,So you've got some flesh to show us?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,So you don't have nipples, but you do have the main event, right?
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,I swear, if you're smooth down there too, someone's going home in pieces.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Whatever. Just strip already.
3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so I noticed. Shut up and strip already.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,A whole lot of waiting and nothing to show for it.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Is that really as big as it gets?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=uninterested.png,That's it...? That's really it...?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed.png,Don't try and pretend we're the same. Small tits are much hotter than small dicks.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=sad.png,... Am I in hell?... Is that what this is? Is that why you all have small penises?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=angry.png,How?! How did I end up in a game with <i>four</i> guys with small dicks?! 
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance2:,marker:PenisChance3=angry.png,Are you kidding me?! <i>You're</i> small too?! This is ridiculous!
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance:,marker:PenisChance2=uninterested.png,Aw come on! Yours is small too?
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-not_crotch_visible&male:1-,count-crotch_visible&male:1,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-not_crotch_visible&male:3,count-small_penis:4,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,Oh, I think it's reacting to me.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,When's the last time you've had that "serviced?" Or serviced by a ghost, for that matter?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,You know, I've never possessed a <i>man</i> before. Want to be my first?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Yeah, really anatomically accurate.
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Who the heck designed you?
3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=horny.png,Oh, good. You <i>do</i> have a penis.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Whoa. That's much bigger than I thought it would be.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,If there's anything that brings me back to life, I hope it's your dick.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=horny.png,Ah, so you have both sets, then? Aren't you a fun toy.
3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=interested.png,Wow. It must take <i>a lot</i> of blood to get that thing up. I bet you just absolutely <i>gush</i> when you get cut, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,Yeah, I'm not so cute now that someone else gets their tits out.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,You see mine, I see yours. Sounds fair to me.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ini&sayingmarker;ini_personality:=shocked.png,<i>Whoa.</i>
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=horny.png,Finally. Take it off nice and slowly for me, Twilight.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs1=uninterested.png,Great, now no one's going to look at mine anymore... Why look at the tiny ghost boobs when the <i>big</i> ghost boobs are right over there...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! I knew hiding was pointless!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! Nothing can hide from Spooky!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Ha! Way to go, Winslow!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Hmm... I'm not sure which side I want to win this one...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=interested.png,Huh. I guess it's not a <i>total</i> shame that you're a love fairy.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=calm.png,Huh. Looks like it didn't matter what order you took off your clothes in, since either way, you'd have wound up naked anyway.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Aw, looks like you have to show your breasts now anyway. How sad.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I wouldn't mind either.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=excited.png,Oh good, the bee came back! Quick, someone catch it!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=calm.png,Sure. Should take some attention away from mine, at least.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested.png,See, there's nothing wrong with a pair like that.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested.png,Don't underestimate the small things.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=uninterested.png,Covering with your hair. That's a good idea. Too bad mine is perpetually blowing in spectral wind...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=annoyed.png,It's not adorable when someone else exposes themselves.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=uninterested.png,Great, you're making mine look smaller.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could do that too if I wanted to, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for apparating underwear?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Aww, no-one's going to take me seriously with boobs like that on the table.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Way to make a girl feel inadequate.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=uninterested.png,I could make mine that big too, you know. I just don't want to.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed.png,So what if those are the perfect size to smother someone with? I can smother someone with mine too!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,There's nothing protecting it now, ~name~.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Losing your ~clothing~, huh? That's too bad.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,Losing your ~clothing~, huh? Sure makes me appreciate my panties.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care when I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,And now it's open and on display.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=uninterested.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either. Usually...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=uninterested.png,I normally go without underwear anyway. Er, <i>normally</i>.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!


#naked
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=horny.png,About time you showed yourself off.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,It doesn't <i>normally</i> take me getting naked to get a guy's shirt off, but everyone has their off days.
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=happy.png,I guess you were just so scared by me that you couldn't talk, huh?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, I was staring. So what? What are you gonna do, slap me?
-3-male_chest_is_visible=calm.png,I suppose it's good enough for a cage of meat.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=sad.png,Great. Even the robot has bigger breasts than me...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,Hey. Where are your nipples? I feel ripped off...
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,No nipples? That's so... uncanny valley.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=interested.png,I wonder what happened to give you the courage to speak.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,Nice tights.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,Well, come on. Show us your meat stick.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,You got to see all of me, so this is the least you could do.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,So you don't have nipples, but you do have the main event, right?
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,I swear, if you're smooth down there too, someone's going home in pieces.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Whatever. Just strip already.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so I noticed. Shut up and strip already.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=uninterested.png,I guess that's something to chew on.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Aw, come on. You have less dick than I have boob.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Is that really as big as it gets? Why don't I try some ghostly tricks on it and see if it gets bigger?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=uninterested.png,Saying I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I need a much stronger word than that...
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=sad.png,... Am I in hell?... Is that what this is? Is that why you all have small penises?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=angry.png,How?! How did I end up in a game with <i>four</i> guys with small dicks?! 
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance2:,marker:PenisChance3=angry.png,Are you kidding me?! <i>You're</i> small too?! This is ridiculous!
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance:,marker:PenisChance2=uninterested.png,Aw come on! Yours is small too?
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-not_crotch_visible&male:1-,count-crotch_visible&male:1,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-not_crotch_visible&male:3,count-small_penis:4,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Yeah, just wave that sucker around.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,Hmm... I guess losing right about now wouldn't be so bad...
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,You don't need condoms when you have sex with ghosts. Just something for you to consider.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,If you let me win, I'll show you how you can use that with a ghost.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Yeah, really anatomically accurate.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Who the heck designed you?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=horny.png,Oh, good. You <i>do</i> have a penis.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could choke someone with that! Well, not me though, I'm already dead.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Say, if you let me win, I'll let you put that wherever you want. Even places that you can't on mortal women.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,I couldn't have made one better myself.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=horny.png,Ah, so you have both sets, then? Aren't you a fun toy.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=interested.png,Wow. It must take <i>a lot</i> of blood to get that thing up. I bet you just absolutely <i>gush</i> when you get cut, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested.png,Oh, finally getting your girls out, ~name~?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ini&sayingmarker;ini_personality:=shocked.png,<i>Whoa.</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=horny.png,Finally. Take it off nice and slowly for me, Twilight.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs1=uninterested.png,Great, now no one's going to look at mine anymore... Why look at the tiny ghost boobs when the <i>big</i> ghost boobs are right over there...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! I knew hiding was pointless!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! Nothing can hide from Spooky!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Ha! Way to go, Winslow!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Hmm... I'm not sure which side I want to win this one...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=interested.png,Huh. I guess it's not a <i>total</i> shame that you're a love fairy.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=calm.png,Huh. Looks like it didn't matter what order you took off your clothes in, since either way, you'd have wound up naked anyway.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Aw, looks like you have to show your breasts now anyway. How sad.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I wouldn't mind either.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=excited.png,Oh good, the bee came back! Quick, someone catch it!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=calm.png,Sure. Should take some attention away from mine, at least.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Mmm... those are some nice toys.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=uninterested.png,Covering with your hair. That's a good idea. Too bad mine is perpetually blowing in spectral wind...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=interested.png,Ooh... Would you mind if I... possessed those?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could've done that too if I wanted to, though...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for apparating underwear?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked.png,You could smother someone with those! Well, not me though, I'm already dead.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed.png,People always think the bigger monsters are the worst ones, but it's the small ones you should worry about.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=uninterested.png,Big breasts are as overrated as giant monsters. And as impractical as them, too.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=annoyed.png,You don't need that much boob to have a good time.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Looks like you finally have to remove your ~clothing~ now, ~name~.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,And now you have to get naked too.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care that I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-naked:1=calm.png,I may have stolen your thunder a bit, ~name~.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,That must not be as exciting after having seen a dead girl's.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=innocent.png,And now we're even.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Feeling free yet? Not as free as me, I bet.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Did you know that ghosts and humans can do a special form of scissoring that's even better than normal? How about I show you?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=uninterested.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either. Not that I'm normally <i>naked</i>...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=uninterested.png,I normally go without underwear anyway. Er, <i>normally</i>.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=excited.png,Come on, then, let me see!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,If you're waiting for me to beg, that's not gonna happen. I'm not <i>that</i> desperate.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=happy.png,I guess you were just so scared by me that you couldn't talk, huh?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, I was staring. So what? What are you gonna do, slap me?
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-exposed:1-=happy.png,At least there's someone here to show off.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-exposed:1-=distracted.png,Finally, something good!
-2-male_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Flex for me, I want to see your sinew.
-2-male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,No scars, huh? How about we change that sometime?
-2-male_chest_is_visible=distracted.png,I sure would like to run my knife along that chest...
-2-male_chest_is_visible=happy.png,I'd like to run some razors on your seducing skin... In a sexy way...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=sad.png,Great. Even the robot has bigger breasts than me...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,Hey. Where are your nipples? I feel ripped off...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,No nipples? That's so... uncanny valley.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=interested.png,I wonder what happened to give you the courage to speak.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,Nice tights.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=excited.png,Come on! Let me see it already!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=happy.png,That's it. Give me a full look at your manhood.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,So you don't have nipples, but you do have the main event, right?
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,I swear, if you're smooth down there too, someone's going home in pieces.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Whatever. Just strip already.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so I noticed. Shut up and strip already.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exposed:1-=excited.png,At least <i>someone</i> picked a good time to strip.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exposed:1-=excited.png,Finally, something good!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-exposed:1-=happy.png,About time!

-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Did you ever think of ways your small penis could get you killed?... Oh, no reason...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,You're gonna have to do more than that to catch my interest. I look forward to seeing you try, though...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=uninterested.png,You don't seriously expect me to care about that tiny thing, do you?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=annoyed.png,I'd rather go back to using my imagination than stare at <i>that</i> to get off.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=sad.png,... Am I in hell?... Is that what this is? Is that why you all have small penises?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=angry.png,How?! How did I end up in a game with <i>four</i> guys with small dicks?! 
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance2:,marker:PenisChance3=angry.png,Are you kidding me?! <i>You're</i> small too?! This is ridiculous!
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance:,marker:PenisChance2=uninterested.png,Aw come on! Yours is small too?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exposed:2=calm.png,Aw... I'll take what I can get.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exposed:2=uninterested.png,Sure wish I had someone else to look at right now...
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exposed:2=uninterested.png,Just know that the moment I have someone else to look at, your penis will be irrelivant.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-exposed:2=annoyed.png,You'd better be one of those guys who knows how to make up for his tiny penis.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-not_crotch_visible&male:1-,count-crotch_visible&male:1,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-not_crotch_visible&male:3,count-small_penis:4,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,I know where you could put that to use, ~name~.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh yeah... That's the stuff...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Ooh yeah. How about I float over there and show you what kinds of things a ghost can do for mortals?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,Ooh... I want to haunt your dick...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Yeah, really anatomically accurate.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Who the heck designed you?
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=horny.png,Oh, good. You <i>do</i> have a penis.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,It must take a lot of blood to get that thing up. Hmm. What would happen if you lost it all?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,A dick like <i>that</i> needs a ghost chick. It could <i>all</i> fit inside and not break anything!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=excited.png,A dick like <i>that</i> needs a ghost chick. You'd break a <i>mortal</i> partner!
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,That's the sexiest monster I've ever seen. There... really aren't a lot of them...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=horny.png,Ah, so you have both sets, then? Aren't you a fun toy.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=interested.png,Wow. It must take <i>a lot</i> of blood to get that thing up. I bet you just absolutely <i>gush</i> when you get cut, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Mmmm... I could always do with another pair of tits.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ini&sayingmarker;ini_personality:=shocked.png,<i>Whoa.</i>
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=horny.png,Finally. Take it off nice and slowly for me, Twilight.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs1=uninterested.png,Great, now no one's going to look at mine anymore... Why look at the tiny ghost boobs when the <i>big</i> ghost boobs are right over there...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! I knew hiding was pointless!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! Nothing can hide from Spooky!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Ha! Way to go, Winslow!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Hmm... I'm not sure which side I want to win this one...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=interested.png,Huh. I guess it's not a <i>total</i> shame that you're a love fairy.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=calm.png,Huh. Looks like it didn't matter what order you took off your clothes in, since either way, you'd have wound up naked anyway.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Aw, looks like you have to show your breasts now anyway. How sad.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I wouldn't mind either.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=excited.png,Oh good, the bee came back! Quick, someone catch it!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=calm.png,Sure. Should take some attention away from mine, at least.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Yeah, they're so sweet.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited.png,Nice!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Small just means more, ah, sensitive.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Want me to show you why you should be glad to have a small chest?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=uninterested.png,Covering with your hair. That's a good idea. Too bad mine is perpetually blowing in spectral wind...
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=horny.png,Oh, wanna let me show you what you could do with them?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could've done that too if I wanted to, though...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for apparating underwear?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Oh, the things I could do with those...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,<i>Stupid big, sexy boobs...</i>
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,They may be big, but, ah... but I bet they're not as sensitive as mine...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=horny.png,They're big, so what. I'll be over her, enjoying my <i>small, not-so-troublesome</i> chest.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,My, you're giving me something to look forward to.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=interested.png,Showing me your pussy? How sweet of you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care that I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh, I could show you so many things to do with that. You learn these things over the decades...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,Hahh... Take a look at me and see how I use mine. I've had a lot of practice with it...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Did you know that the stuff a woman and a ghost can do together is even more special than the stuff a man and a ghost can do? Want me to show you what I mean?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,Aw yeah... I'd eat you out like a kaiju eating a condo...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=uninterested.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either. Not that I'm normally <i>naked</i>...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=uninterested.png,I normally go without underwear anyway. Er, <i>normally</i>.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!

#finished
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=annoyed.png,Eh, <i>now</i> you're taking ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~ off?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible=uninterested.png,I am quite dissatisfied with your performance, making me wait this long to see your chest.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=happy.png,I guess you were just so scared by me that you couldn't talk, huh?
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, I was staring. So what? What are you gonna do, slap me?
-1-male_chest_is_visible=calm.png,That's serviceable, I guess.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=distracted.png,I... guess I can't really get mad.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=distracted.png,Well... It has been a while since the last time I got to see some chests, so...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=sad.png,Great. Even the robot has bigger breasts than me...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,Hey. Where are your nipples? I feel ripped off...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=shocked.png,No nipples? That's so... uncanny valley.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;link:=interested.png,I wonder what happened to give you the courage to speak.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;corrin_m:=calm.png,Nice tights.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=annoyed.png,You know, you could have done this earlier.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Not so smug now, are you?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=interested.png,So you don't have nipples, but you do have the main event, right?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,I swear, if you're smooth down there too, someone's going home in pieces.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Whatever. Just strip already.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so I noticed. Shut up and strip already.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested.png,Oh. Is that why you kept it hidden?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,All that waiting for this?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Some things are worth waiting for. This is not one of those things.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm.png,Well... At least I'm already done.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=bored.png,I'm already done. Your small penis is not my problem.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=sad.png,... Am I in hell?... Is that what this is? Is that why you all have small penises?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:8,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance3:=angry.png,How?! How did I end up in a game with <i>four</i> guys with small dicks?! 
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:7,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance2:,marker:PenisChance3=angry.png,Are you kidding me?! <i>You're</i> small too?! This is ridiculous!
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:6,count-role;self&saidmarker;PenisChance:,marker:PenisChance2=uninterested.png,Aw come on! Yours is small too?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,priority:0,count-not_crotch_visible&male:1-,count-crotch_visible&male:1,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,count-not_crotch_visible&male:3,count-small_penis:4,marker:PenisChance=calm.png,I suppose I can't complain. Yours isn't the only penis here, thankfully, so there's still a chance of seeing an arousing one.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Well, there's still time for you to put it to use.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Well, it's not too late for you to put that to use.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Yeah, really anatomically accurate.
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=annoyed.png,So you <i>do</i> have a penis, but you don't have nipples? Who the heck designed you?
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;9s:=horny.png,Oh, good. You <i>do</i> have a penis.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,You could break someone with that. But who...?
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Seeing that is worth the wait.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,I should kill you for making me wait so long to see that. But then once you're dead, we can have hot ghost sex.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mettaton:=horny.png,Ah, so you have both sets, then? Aren't you a fun toy.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jotaro:=interested.png,Wow. It must take <i>a lot</i> of blood to get that thing up. I bet you just absolutely <i>gush</i> when you get cut, huh?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,This would have been useful earlier.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=happy.png,Eh, there's never a bad time for more breasts.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;ini&sayingmarker;ini_personality:=shocked.png,<i>Whoa.</i>
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;6:=horny.png,Finally. Take it off nice and slowly for me, Twilight.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs1=uninterested.png,Great, now no one's going to look at mine anymore... Why look at the tiny ghost boobs when the <i>big</i> ghost boobs are right over there...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! I knew hiding was pointless!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;5:=excited.png,Ha! Nothing can hide from Spooky!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=excited.png,Ha! Way to go, Winslow!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,Hmm... I'm not sure which side I want to win this one...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=interested.png,Huh. I guess it's not a <i>total</i> shame that you're a love fairy.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=calm.png,Huh. Looks like it didn't matter what order you took off your clothes in, since either way, you'd have wound up naked anyway.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Aw, looks like you have to show your breasts now anyway. How sad.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=happy.png,I wouldn't mind either.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee2:=excited.png,Oh good, the bee came back! Quick, someone catch it!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=horny.png,Oh yeah, nice and slow...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=interested.png,Oh. You look... normal. Well... okay.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=calm.png,Okay.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=horny.png,Ooh, are you going to burn something off?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;april:=horny.png,Ooh, bra first? I like how you play.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=happy.png,Say, you're pretty good at terrorizing people, you know that?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;4:=calm.png,Sure. Should take some attention away from mine, at least.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,These last rolls haven't really been good for you. Let's hope this next one will be worse.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;saki_zls:,id:8=calm.png,Tsk tsk. Should've used staples instead of bandages. Or at least used skin tape.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ugh. It's no fun to stare when you want me to.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=uninterested.png,Ugh. Just strip already!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=horny.png,Wow, you're going for your bra next? You really <i>don't</i> like underwear, huh?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=calm.png,You're going to remove the <i>full</i> swimsuit, right? You wouldn't want to make me mad again, would you?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;panty&stage;0&sayingmarker;panty_stripping_dress:,id:33=shocked.png,Y-you're a ghost hunter too? B-but why? Y-you have better things you could be doing!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:56,marker:Polly_Passing1=calm.png,She's not really going anywhere. I pull this trick all the time. Mortals always fall for it.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=horny.png,You know, I don't have anything left to do now but float here and stare at those.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7b:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Finally, Vriska's topless!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;7a:=horny.png,Aw yeah! Skimpy swimsuit time!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;videl:=uninterested.png,Covering with your hair. That's a good idea. Too bad mine is perpetually blowing in spectral wind...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,Ooh, no bra, huh? Well, I don't blame you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm.png,I'd kill for breasts like those. Not that it worked last time...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;7:=horny.png,Ah, there we go. Now I can see your body for all that it is.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;myriam:=happy.png,At least you have a nice rack.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;florina&saidmarker;bee3:=sad.png,Aw, you killed it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to catch a <i>ghost</i> bee?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,Ghosts can't get sick, but, uh... I'm not touching those.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=uninterested.png,For once, I'm glad I can't actually touch mortals.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=horny.png,Hey, why don't you push your shirt out of the way for us?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;kyu:=uninterested.png,I could've done that too if I wanted to, though...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nayru&notsaidmarker;null_possess:=happy.png,I love a good bra fire.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Boobs2=annoyed.png,I mean, I get it, big boobs are great, especially big <i>ghost</i> boobs, but <i>little</i> ghost boobs need attention too...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad that my clothes are completely incorporeal.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;elaine:=happy.png,I sure am glad my clothes can't be damaged by mortal hands.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=calm.png,I'm sure you will...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aella:=calm.png,No bra, huh? Great decision. No, really.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,Nothing! I saw nothing! I have no idea how your trick works!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey&stage;6:=shocked.png,W-- it really did vanish! B-but that's impossible! I would've seen it happen!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;croix:=horny.png,Oh! I didn't expect that!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=horny.png,Ooh, finally, you shoot off something of value.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=annoyed.png,Wait, we're counting that as her turn? And you got mad at <i>me</i> for apparating underwear?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla:=sad.png,We're really going to allow this...? Fine...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Yeah! About time!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking this whole time? That's... impressive.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ini:=shocked.png,You were faking? But... nothing gets past the dead.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,priority:301,count-role;target&character;polly&saidmarker;UnfinishedBusiness:,id:57,marker:Polly_Passing2=bored.png,Next time, try to come up with something original. Nice boobs, though.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked.png,You're still in the game <i>and</i> you have massive boobs? Some girls have all the luck.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=uninterested.png,Yeah, well, I wouldn't have wanted to masturbate to those anyway...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=interested.png,Say, did you know it's easier to haunt women who have big chests? It's true. It's because of, uh... all the milk. Yeah...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=uninterested.png,My chest may be small, but at least I'll never have back problems. Not that I have a spine, technically, but still...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;raph:=happy.png,Funny, I didn't know they made bras for butts.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=happy.png,Funny, it almost seems like this <i>isn't</i> what you came here to do.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;mikey:=happy.png,If you say so.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;leo:=happy.png,Looks like it's the perfect size to me.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,You can say that again.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;april&saidmarker;donny:=happy.png,It sure didn't.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny.png,I may have just done myself, but that doesn't mean I won't appreciate yours, ~name~.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,Well, that's something nice.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=excited.png,Alright! Take 'em off, Pinkie!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;2:=innocent.png,Great choice.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked1=annoyed.png,Great, now people won't care that I'm <i>naked</i>, either. You're just going to steal everything from me, aren't you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&losses;1-9:=excited.png,Ha <i>ha</i>! Looks like your trick didn't save you!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=calm.png,I know those sounds. Ghosts are experts on moans, and <i>those</i> moans are purely sexual.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=interested.png,I'm going to watch very carefully this time. You won't be fooling me again.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=horny.png,Lemme guess: you're naked under there, aren't you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=calm.png,Let me guess...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;6:=horny.png,Oh good, there go the rest of your flowers.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,Oh no...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=happy.png,Or you could just go without them. That's always a fun option.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=horny.png,Panties off already? I like your style.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska:=calm.png,That last roll sure was bad. I wouldn't be surprised if this one leaves you naked.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;sayla&timeinstage;5-99:=uninterested.png,Ugh, about time. Curse you and your stupid one piece swimsuit
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=annoyed.png,Well why not? That's what you came here for, isn't it?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=uninterested.png,Yeah, so what if anyone was staring? That's what we came here to do.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=happy.png,You do that. I'll just float here.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=horny.png,Oh! You make me want to start again.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=distracted.png,Mmm... I may just start again...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saidmarker;pinka_start&notsaidmarker;pinka_end2:=innocent.png,And <i>that</i> is why I like knives so much.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;mia:=horny.png,Boobs out or not, either way, you lost a piece of your underwear.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8b:=annoyed.png,Grr. Stupid towel. Your practically more covered now than you were last round.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jolyne:=happy.png,Haha. Silly mortals and their fallible memory abilities. Ghosts never forget things, you know.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;aimee:=interested.png,Huh. Humans can cum from near-death experiences. You'd think that'd be something I'd already know, but no.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;1:=uninterested.png,I can't say I'm much of a fan of underwear either. Not that I'm normally <i>naked</i>...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;wiifitfemale:=uninterested.png,I normally go without underwear anyway. Er, <i>normally</i>.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like we already couldn't see plenty before...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Like your hair was really in the way of anything...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;jura:=uninterested.png,Yeah yeah, brag about your size more why don't you...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;streaming-chan:=calm.png,My vote's for The Hulk.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;futaba:=horny.png,No panties either? You are my kind of girl.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;vriska&saidmarker;8a:=horny.png,Oh, well, that's close enough.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;raven:=happy.png,Oh. Bottomless. I was half right.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=shocked.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;moon:=distracted.png,That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen... and I'm kind of into it...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;polly:,marker:Polly_Naked2=uninterested.png,Well, at least you're shaved...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;3:=innocent.png,You know, you're probably the most fun person here, Twilight.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,You'd better not grow more.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;amalia&stage;7:=annoyed.png,If you grow more flowers, I'm apparating a weed wacker.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,Your panties? But your hands were up at your bra's hook!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;joey:=shocked.png,How's that even possible? Your hands were busy with your bra!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan:=horny.png,Ooh, looks like you've been practicing your teamwork.
-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;morrigan&saidmarker;lilith_sister:=shocked.png,Wait, did you say "sister?"

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
