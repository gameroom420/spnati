SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This interpretation of Undertale's Chara leans more on 'Narrator Chara' theory than 'Killer Kid with a Knife' theory. Spoilers for both Undertale and Chara's SPNATI interpretation below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NARRATOR CHARA THEORY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is strong reason to believe Chara is not only active in Undertale's genocide route. The differing text colors - standard white vs genocide red - do not always line up with
the narrator saying something genocidal; the 'My Bed' text is white, but 'No Chocolate' is red. Combined with the idea of Serious Mode - where item descriptions become less humorous
when fighting members of Chara's family (Toriel, Asgore, Asriel) there is substantial reason to believe Chara is the narrator regardless of what route is taken in Undertale.

With that established, you can look at other flavor texts in Undertale to paint Chara's personality as rather snarky, with a love of puns, and more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NARRATOR CHARA TL;DR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chara is the flavor text for the game Undertale in all routes, only becoming 'physically manifest' at the end of the game's genocide route. This points to
a personality for Chara that likes puns, gardening, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BRUNETTE - Chara's Undertale sprite has slightly lighter hair than Frisk, but in Kisekae that is still very dark. The shade I used is slightly lighter, but still brown.

MEDIUM HAIR - Chara's Undertale sprite has medium length hair.

RED EYES - Chara's sprite at the end of Genocide has no visible eye color, but when possessing Frisk in post-genocide Pacifist, her eyes are bright red.

PALE-SKINNED - Chara's sprite has much lighter skin than Frisk.

PUBIC HAIR - There was no reason to go for any of the other options, so I simply went with a middle-of-the-road.

LARGE BREASTS - Post-Genocide, Chara states - and shows - that she embodies the process of grinding for stats and 'making numbers grow'. With this there might be some
justification in tagging her as Large Breasts or even Huge Breasts, but I felt that was a reach and instead went with middle-of-the-road.
	-UPDATE May 31 2020 - Based on feedback, the formerly Medium Breasts tag was updated to Large Breasts due to - despite using a size that is the upper range of medium characters -
Chara's body frame would have her in the updated Large Breasts category. I guess this sort of lets me use the 'making numbers grow' justification?

CLOTHING DESTRUCTION - UPDATE MAY 31 2020 - Based on feedback, added Clothing Destruction tag to stages 2, 6, and 7 (Lost Belt, Lost Pants, Lost Bra, all of which Chara uses her knife
to strip.
	-UPDATE JUNE 16 - Based on testing, characters were telling Chara to stop destroying her clothes, when stripping something she was not destroying but came after something she had.
In light of this, I removed the Clothing Destruction tag from all stages and created hidden cases to apply/remove it in the relevant places.

SUPERNATURAL - Post-Genocide, Chara is a literal demon, powerful enough to destroy the entire universe - multiple sources of evidence in Undertale point to that it is indeed
the whole universe, not just 'the world' or even just 'the Underground' - and if that's not worth a Supernatural tag I do not know what is.

SPIRIT - Chara died and came back to life, but not originally in a corporeal manner.

WEAPON - The Real Knife picked up in Undertale's genocide route is thought to have originally belonged to Chara. She holds it here.

BLADE - See WEAPON above.

INDIFFERENT - Post-Genocide, as the embodiment of grinding for stats, I believe Chara would care relatively little about the various quirks of the other opponents and would see them
mostly as nothing more than enemies to be defeated, by both herself and you, the player, her 'partner'. I say 'mostly' because her having absolutely NO interactions with other characters
would be lame.

MEAN - While Narrator Chara theory points to a quirky, pun-loving nature, this is also Post-Genocide Chara, and even mid-Genocide Chara actively encourages you to kill and
chastises you for showing mercy.

SERIOUS - While Narrator Chara's love for puns shows through a bit, she is very dedicated to bringing down the enemy in this interpretation. Furthermore, in the Genocide Route, the
afformentioned 'Serious Mode' in Undertale is active even when not fighting members of Chara's family.

SINGLE - Chara is not romantically involved.

FANTASY - Undertale has magical monsters in it. That's fantasy.

VIDEO GAME - Undertale is a video game.

UNDERTALE - Chara is from the video game Undertale.

CREEPY - Chara's more demonic faces are meant to be this, and her devotion to conquest, power, and victory might come off as uncanny to other enemies.

VILLAIN - While Narrator Chara posits that the player themselves, not Chara, is the driving force behind genocide, post-genocide Chara is nevertheless merciless and cruel.

DEMON - UPDATE AUGUST 12 - The new tag 'demon' has been applied 0-10. If you do Genocide 2+ times, Chara refers to herself as a demon. Given the jumpscare face she has, I am inclined
to believe her.

HIGH HEELS - UPDATE AUGUST 12 - The new tag 'high heels' has been applied 0-2. The model for Chara's shoes, when viewed from the side, has heels.

THROWS THE GAME - UPDATE AUGUST 12 - The new tag 'throw the game' has been applied via a case when Chara starts to throw, for obvious reasons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL BEHAVIOR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per her dialogue in Genocide, Chara sees herself as your partner, and vice versa. While in the Genocide Route she claims that, after erasing the world, she will follow you
'to the next world', you have to actually try to convince her to let you get the Undertale world back. This leads me to believe that the 'other worlds' Chara mentioned were not Undertale
 but, in fact,  other games entirely. The Undertale Genocide Route is, after all, an open parody about what it means to grind for stats, and it therefore follows that the embodiment
of doing just that would linger. Obviously, Toby Fox cannot put his character hovering over your shoulder when you get an ammo upgrade in DOOM or something, but that is how I
interpret it.

As such, Chara's dialogue indicates she has been following you through other games too, for some years now. She also, as per her mannerisms in Genocide, speaks rather properly and
deliberately, mimicking Toriel's speech patterns the same way Asriel mimicks Asgore's.

Chara also has the full 8 layers and plays with Best AI constantly, following the whole 'embodiment of growing power' deal. However, to make this not unfair to the player, Chara's gimmick
is that once the other opponents have all been defeated, leaving just the player and her, she will intentionally begin to throw the game.

Chara is extremely eager for enemies to strip and masturbate, simply because that is how enemies are 'defeated' in SPNATI, but will be regretful and almost kind to the player
if they have to do the same. She also has a minor theme of the number 9 going through her dialogue, reacting when she approaches 9 wins in a row, has a
high/pair/three-of-kind/four-of-a-kind of 9s, etc, stemming from the theme of the number 9 in the later stages of Undertale's genocide route.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SITUATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THROW - NOTEWORTHY - When it's just Chara and the Player, she begins to throw the game. She'll react differently to swapping cards, to hands, and to stripping. NOTE: This has a case
where the player has seen Chara throw before. The situation itself points to the 'generic case' and should work for the non-generic, but still. Double-check the functionality.
	-UPDATE JULY 25: Reduced priority from Must Target to Noteworthy.

DEMON EYES - NOTEWORTHY - Two of Chara's poses, DemonHappy and DemonAngry, feature her hollow-eyed look from Undertale. NOTE: This specific callout only references one time she uses these
poses, to properly target them instead use Filter -> Dialogue -> Pose.

HIDDEN BELT - FYI - The second item Chara removes is her belt, which is hidden beneath her shirt. As such, removing it does not actually change her appearance. Some opponents may find
that unfair. NOTE: This specific callout only references one possible case for Chara stripping her belt. Make sure to target the general 'stripping, in stage 1' case instead. Though this
points to the Generic Case already, but still. Double-check the functionality.

REFUSE TO REMOVE - NOTEWORTHY - After removing her last layer of clothing, Chara will say she refuses to strip either her knife or locket, saying she would rather forfeit than do so.

KNIFETURBATE - FYI - Chara does not let go of her knife at any point in the game, including her masturbation sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERSISTENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chara makes heavy use of Persistent Markers to maintain memory throughout, and even during, games.

-Chara will notice if she's stripping an item she's stripped in a past game, and will not be as upset about it the 2+ time.
-Chara will notice if the player constantly selects and deselects her without starting a game.
-Chara will notice if the player plays with her multiple times.
-Chara will notice if the player plays with a specific opponent multiple times.
-Chara will notice if the player brings her to a background with the Sun out, and will doubly notice it if you do this often.
-Chara will notice if you restart midgame, including the following special cases:
	-Generic reset midgame.
	-Resetting if the player loses the very first hand and restarts immediately there.
	-Resetting in the first few rounds of the game.
	-Resetting if the player is doing poorly.
	-Resetting if Chara is doing poorly.
	-Resetting if both the player AND Chara are doing poorly.
	-Resetting if the player has nearly won the game against the last non-Chara opponent.
	-Resetting if the player was eliminated.
	-Resetting if Chara was eliminated.
	-Resetting if both the player AND Chara were eliminated.
	-Resetting if everyone other than the player were eliminated, but had yet to finish masturbating.
	-Resetting if all other opponents were removed and Chara was in the midst of throwing the game.
	-Resetting if Chara was in the midst of masturbating.
	-Resetting if the player was in the midst of an attempt for her Locket collectible (More below.)
	-Resetting if the player had failed an attempt for her Locket collectible but the game was still ongoing (More below.)
-Chara will notice if she and the player both lost, and she has NOT seen a case where either she or the player won.
-Chara will notice if she and the player both lost, but the player has won before.
-Chara will notice if the player wins and has won before.
-Chara will notice if the player wins with her the first time, after having lost before.
-Chara will notice if she or the player won, after having both lost before.
-Chara will notice if she won, if the player had won before.
-Chara will notice if she won, and the player has lost but NOT won before.
-And probably more I'm forgetting lol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME REACTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chara will react to specific Player Names upon being selected:

-Miss, the default female name.
-Mister, the default male name.
-Miss, but the player is actually male.
-Mister, but the player is actually female.
-Papyrus
-Sans
-Undyne
-Alphys
-Flowey
-Mettaton, bonus reaction if the actual Mettaton opponent is also selected.
-Chara, bonus reaction if the oldschool Chara opponent is also selected.
-Asgore, Asriel and Toriel, all of whom will have additional reactions if the player goes back, changes their name, and starts the game afterwards.
-Gaster - Forcibly resets the player to the start screen when they try to start the game. This is intentional.
-Frisk - See collectible THE LOCKET below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPILOGUE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chara has one Epilogue, Power, available with the only prerequisite being to win the game. There is no sex in this epilogue, however the epilogue itself varies, with the use of
markers, depending on the following conditions:

Case 1 - The player is seeing the epilogue for the first time.
Case 2 - The player is seeing the epilogue in the epilogue viewer, with additional sub-cases if the player does this multiple times.
Case 3 - The player is seeing the epilogue normally, for the 2+ time.

After the epilogue, the player is forcibly booted to the start screen. This is intentional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COLLECTIBLES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REAL KNIFE
-Default collectible. Just win a game that Chara is part of. The 99 counter is to reference how, in Undertale, the Real Knife item has 99 Attack.
You do not need to actually beat Chara 99 times.

CHOCOLATE BAR
-Lose a game that Chara loses too. Self-explanatory.

SANS'S TROMBONE
-Following Narrator Chara theory, even grim and cruel post-Geno Chara likes cracking puns. Listen to her say enough and you unlock this.

THE LOCKET
-Beat Chara's 'Hard Mode'. Reference to the Undertale joke-mode where, upon choosing the name Frisk, the game goes to an intentionally incomplete Hard Mode with stronger enemies.
To unlock, do the following:
	-Select the name Frisk.
	-Select no more than 6 clothing items for yourself.
	-Start a game with a full roster of 4 enemies, including Chara.
	-Beat them all.
The 99 counter is to reference how, in Undertale, the Locket item has 99 Defense. You do not actually need to beat 'Hard Mode' 99 times.

☯☼☜👎✌👍❄☜👎☸
-It spells [REDACTED] in wingdings. This is a secret collectible and, as such, not normally visible. Name yourself Gaster and attempt to start a game to unlock.
	-Subtitle is A BLAST FROM THE PAST
	-Text is SEE YOU SOON
	-Unlock Hint is NAME YOURSELF GASTER AND ATTEMPT TO START A GAME

PLANNED FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-I would like to add a sex scene to the epilogue. Just have to get the writing right. Though I am having second thoughts about that. I've done a lot of work on the new epilogue but
I don't want to 'sunk cost' myself. Not every epilogue needs to be a sex scene.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLANNED CHARACTER INTERACTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planned interactions not yet implemented for any number of reasons.

-A 'spider donut, don't worry, spider didn't' joke with Amy.
-Interactions with Monika, particularly her glitches. However, as Chara and Monika both use 'different types' of 4th wall screwiness, and given my limited knowledge of JS, I might
have to resign myself to simply ignoring her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not want to have Chara actually end up 'fighting people and effortlessly destroying them with her universe-destroying power', or end up in a
case of 'threatening people with her universe-destroying power' or even 'laugh off other peoples' threats because of her universe-destroying power.'
I do not, under ANY circumstance, want to end up preaching about Chara's power in a "WELL ACTUALLY!" manner since it is my understanding that many people do still see Chara as
the 'Killer Kid with a Knife'.

I'd had the idea to make two Charas, one male and one female, but decided that the neccesitation of Special Cases for them interacting with each other would make me lose my mind.
	-Maybe an alternate costume one day ala Kazuma?

I'd had the idea to make Chara somehow notice you're using Debug Mode, but aside from the technical difficulties in actually implementing that, Debug Mode is there for the purpose of,
well, debugging. It ruins the whole point of a Debug Mode if the game behaves differently when it's in use.

I'd had the idea of cases if Chara has 'gotten used' to stripping a few items, but is now going towards a new item she is not used to stripping. But since this could only happen once
per layer, EVER, and even then being unlikely (If Chara loses the first time you play with her, you'll never see these cases) I decided it's not worth the effort.
