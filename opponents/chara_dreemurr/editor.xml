This interpretation of Chara leans more on 'Narrator Chara' theory than 'Genocidal Kid with Knife' theory.

I won't go in detail on what they are. TL;DR Chara's not the kid with a knife in Undertale's genocide route, but rather we/Frisk/whatever you want to call it are, and Chara is the text in the box, commenting on what happens. Post Genocide, Chara has become a literal demon and the embodiment of grinding for stats, as stated in the game, and is powerful enough to 1-shot all of space-time and destroy the universe; also as stated in the game. Chara is extraordinarily powerful, but not extremely flashy about it. Also, I don't really want to flaunt this power in terms of 'fighting other characters and no-selling their attempts to hurt her'. A lot of people still see Chara as the 'Kid with a Knife' and I don't want to get preachy about "WELL ACTUALLY!"  

In this interpretation, Chara follows the player to any other game they play, embodying the grinding of stats and raising of numbers for each of them in turn. Be that getting ammo upgrades in an FPS or buying more grandmas in Cookie Clicker. And, now, she is here in SPNATI.

This Chara views herself as being on the same team as the player, and her dialogue reflects that, so long as she OR the player wins the game, she considers that a victory. (Her Epilogues, however, do not).

She views other AI as nothing but enemies for her and the player to defeat, a task she is highly devoted to. Most of her responses to an enemy losing have special cases if both her and the player are defeated already.

Chara has 8 Layers and plays with Best AI constantly, however if it comes down to just her and the Player, she will begin to deliberately throw the game to grant you victory.

Chara makes heavy use of Persistant Markers and Hidden Lines  to maintain memory throughout multiple playthroughs. This has a large amount of influence on her lines, from having her notice if you play with specific characters often, being less upset about stripping an item she has stripped in the past, noticing if you reset midgame, noticing if you constantly deselect/select her on the menu screen, etc.

True to Narrator Chara theory, Chara is also fond of puns, and has a few to say and remarks on those I could find (Sadly, a lot of puns are not marked in other opponents...). She also has a variety of responses based on the player's name; if the player selects the name Frisk, Chara will give instructions on how to enable her 'Hard Mode' which is required for one of her collectibles.
 ALSO: Chara makes use of Scripts to forcibly reset the game, in two places. The first is her Player Name Gaster easter egg where, if the Player Name=Gaster her Hand Any case related to that crashes it. The second is the off-screen text box at the end of her Epilogue. Both of those should have the code &lt;script&gt;restartGame();&lt;/script&gt; inserted into them; something the CE deletes when saving Chara so MAKE SURE TO ADD THEM MANUALLY IN THE XML EACH TIME YOU SAVE.</note>
