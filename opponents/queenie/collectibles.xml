        <title>Damaged plush</title>
        <subtitle>Visage of Evil</subtitle>
        <text>A terribly mangled plush toy depicting an inditerminable creature of villainous origin, though it's cutesy appearance betrays it's creator's ability to portray such a thing.

Someone, or something, seems to have relished in rending it's squishy body on multiple occassions, before sloppily stitching the beast's wounds shut. Despite their best efforts, however, the plush was dealt a fatal, irreperable blow as the damage won out, spilling the toy's fluffed guts to the open air.



&lt;i&gt;"What to do? She vowed to love everything in the world, but all that's left was a collapsing heart.
