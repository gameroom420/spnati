        <title>Crownguard Emblem</title>
        <subtitle>"A Crownguard never falters."</subtitle>
        <text>Luxanna Luxanna—or Lux, as she prefers to be called—grew up in the Demacian city of High Silvermere, along with her older brother Garen. They were born to the prestigious Crownguard family, which had served for generations as protectors of the kings of Demacia. Their grandfather saved the king's life at the Battle of Storm's Fang, and their aunt Tianna was named commander of the elite Dauntless Vanguard regiment before Lux was born. </text>

        <subtitle>"Any excuse to twirl my wand!"</subtitle>
        <text>A wand that was gifted to Lux by a fellow mage as they escaped Demacia. It allows her to channel her magic for more powerful spells, including her signature Final Spark. Using Prismatic Barrier, she throws her wand in a target direction, shielding herself and any allies it crosses over while it is both outgoing and returning.</text>
