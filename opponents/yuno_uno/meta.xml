    <description>Yuno was an ordinary second generation Japanese-American college student before he discovered his calling. Now, Yuno and his friends face off against fellow duelers in the game of UNOÂ®. The stakes are high, but through the bonds of fate, their friendship prevails. Have Faith in the Hands of Chance, and Let it Burn! (Inspiration: "What if UNO was an anime?")</description>
