    <description>Darkness is a crusader from a noble family. She is a massive masochist with extremely perverse fantasies that she gets carried away with. When she truly gets carried away, she often projects her fantasies onto others, misinterpreting their intentions into something more erotic. She is a member of Kazuma's party. She is always willing to throw herself in front of attacks for her allies, although part of this is to fulfill her perverted desires. Despite her masochistic tendencies and the trouble they can cause, she is surprisingly reliable when it counts and cares deeply for her friends.</description>
