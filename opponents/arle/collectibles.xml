        <title>Carbuncle plushie</title>
        <subtitle>You'd have to be brainwashed to believe it's the real thing.</subtitle>
        <text>It had an opening in the back, seems to be a photo of late in the game, with one note attatched: "Gu". You seem to think that's the little guy encouraging you to enjoy the view.</text>
        <unlock>Make Arle lose the game and have his little companion hang around enough for him to help you get a "unique" view of her.
Alternatively have her be the last one to "finish" before the game over screen.</unlock>
