        <text>Great for exploiting gaps in your opponent's defenses, these seem to be one of the most popular ARMS with fans and are Ribbon Girl's signature weapon. A charged punch with one of these will leave an opponent's arms disabled, making them unable to attack or block and greatly reducing their mobility.</text>
