        <title>A date with Mari</title>
        <subtitle>Surprisingly, nothing lewd happens!</subtitle>
        <text>And so, after the game you and Mari spend the night in a theme park! You discover that Mari is very cuddly, and easily amused. Sadly the date is cut short, as Mari's mother calls her to ask why she has not returned. Turns out, Mari didn't even tell her she went out! Before she left though, Mari asked you to take a picture of her. She also asked you to call her sometime, so that you two may go out again. And lastly, she gave you a goodbye kiss on the cheek. What a day!</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Mari.</unlock>
