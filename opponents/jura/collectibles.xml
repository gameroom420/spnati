As her Dread has been modified, it no longer fits in the platforms for standard orders.  Already a senior pilot when Barnette joined and started working in Reg, and first met her when she resisted her loadout.</text>

Unlike Meia and Jura, her Dread was not transformed by the Paksis Pragma, and thus cannot combine with a Vanguard.  Prefers aggressive bombardment loadouts and even tried to order a kamikaze set on one occasion.  Now serves as Chief and Weapons Shop Owner of the Regisystem, managing orders, munitions, and security.</text>

You feel her lipstick smear and her breasts squish.  She's wrapped her naked body around you.  You think that's it, but she goes in for a dozen more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Mwah!  Mwah!  &lt;i&gt;Mwah!&lt;/i&gt;  I'm thanking you properly.  You taught Jura so much!  I'll---&lt;i&gt;mwahmnn---&lt;/i&gt;have to come back one day..."</text>

The "M10" was famous for its two-stage suppressor, giving you ample peace and quiet to take in the Christmas cheer.  Barnette, meanwhile, would fire missiles from it if she could.</text>
