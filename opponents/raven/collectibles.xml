        <text>Raven's dark blue cloak with a hood. It is very comfortable to wear. Not only because it's nice and soft and keeps you warm throughout the day, but also because this cloak helps you mask your feelings and insecurities when you wear it, so that you may continue hiding under that wonky veil of sarcasm and insensitivity.</text>
