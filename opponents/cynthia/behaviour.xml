                <state img="#-fingerup.png" marker="JessieQuesCreation2">I must warn you that this a rather lengthy but gripping story, Jessie, but you can tell me to stop any time if you want. To preface, this came from an ancient manuscript that preceded all of the current political entities. Anyway, here's the story: Stewie already has a time machine built in which he uses to go back in time to get back and embarrass Brian. When Brian finds out, they fight in the time machine, pressing random buttons and switches which makes the machine glitch. It transports them outside of the space-time continuum; non-existence; no past, present, or future; no universe; a blank canvas. Stewie has his return pad that will bring them back to wherever they want to go by locking on to their coordinates. However, it operates on the laws of physics and since they are outside the space-time continuum, there are no laws of physics; they can create their own physics. The only way to get back home is taking a risk that could result in their deaths: overloading the return pad’s reactor to release enough energy to blow them back into the universe. The explosion is successful in propelling them back into reality. A few days later, Stewie brings Brian a diagram of the Big Bang Theory’s cosmic background radiation compared to the energy spectrum of the return pad and they match exactly. This means that the return pad’s explosion was the Big Bang. Stewie explains that time and space didn't exist before their explosion as they were outside the space-continuum. This is due to a temporal causality loop where the universe created Stewie so he could create the universe, so it could create him and on and on. We are then introduced to a character, Bertram, who finds out about Stewie's time machine and uses it to go back in time to kill Leonardo Da Vinci, Stewie's ancestor, essentially killing Stewie and erasing him from history. This creates ripples in time in the present that originated from the past. Although this wouldn't happen with an ordinary person ceasing to exist, Stewie was the one who created the universe. By erasing him from history, he wouldn't be there to create the universe, meaning it never existed. To stop this, Stewie and Brian travel back to before Bertram killed his ancestor. Stewie and Bertram's history goes far back, as they are both children of Peter. Therefore, Bertram couldn't just kill Peter or a recent ancestor on Peter's side as he too would cease to exist, so he had to go back enough generations to snuff Stewie's genus without snuffing out his own. Bertram finally arrives and him and Stewie begin to battle each other for Da Vinci's life. Bertram succeeds in killing Da Vinci where after Stewie also kills Bertram. However, Stewie and Brian are still alive, meaning there is still a chance of him being born. He must have done or will do something to save the universe. He figures since Da Vinci's DNA is inside of him, he himself can pass it on, taking Da Vinci's place. This is a large chance but the only way to find out is to send Brian back to the present. When Brian arrives, everything is still intact, meaning Stewie succeeded. Brian receives a letter from The Vatican that was left by “Da Vinci” 500 years ago. It reads that Stewie placed himself into a cryogenic stasis device and is buried in the basement of their home. Brian goes to dig him up and sure enough Stewie is there. </state>

                <state img="#-stripping.png" marker="OrendiMonsters2">I find your intentions and ethics to be rather questionable, Orendi... but very well, if you're really curious about how you can make your Pokémon stronger and learn more moves, then I suppose it wouldn't hurt if I give the details. You see, there are several types of Pokémon, and their types play a huge role in determining the moves that they can learn. Of course, this doesn't mean that Pokémon of the same types will have the same move set, but instead they will have the same pool of moves that they can learn. And another point I must make is that an individual Pokémon species can have its own unique move sets, and learning those will require familiarity with the Pokémon in particular. Anyhow, teaching a Pokémon a new move requires a lot of practice and repetition. A Pokémon instinctively knows there moves, but it is quite unrefined, which is why repetitions are so pivotal. Although, in the context of you, which in this case are Valresi punching each other, that would be rather easy to teach them, don't you think? I'm not familiar with how Valresi can adapt to teaching, but I would suppose the bigger obstacle would be taming them in the first place. And then after that, you would have to take into account their injuries. Pokémon centers are adept at healing Pokémon injured in battles, but I don't know if the same can be performed for the Valresi. Hmm... quite intriguing indeed. Anyway, I suppose that covers all the basics... Oh! I forgot another thing: when a Pokémon evolves, they usually have a different move set than that of their previous form... Come to think of it, that might not be applicable in your case... Anyway, that's all I have to say on the topic. I hope I was quite clear on the subject matter. Do you have any questions, Orendi?</state>
                <state img="#-stripping.png" marker="OrendiMonsters2">I have a rather ominous feeling as to your goals with this knowledge, but I suppose keeping you informed will not hurt, Orendi. As for your question, how does a Pokémon learn a new move? Well, one thing that will always make your Pokémon - and people in general - better at a certain skill is training. You see, you don't just get good at a certain skill right of the bat. You have to train hard to master it. Not only does it help you develop your muscle memory, but it also makes you physically stronger overall, which in turn makes you better at performing said task. You see how it's all a cycle? Anyway, one of the ways a Pokémon can master their skill is by participating in battle. It all makes sense, doesn't it? The more often you use a move in a meaningful environment, the better it will get. Of course, one downside of battling all the time is that your Pokémon is more likely to get injured, so battling might be the most effective way of gaining a skill, but it's not the only option. Another option you have is to spar with another trainer. Of course, you would ask abut the difference between sparring and battling. Well, in battling, the goal is to make your opponent faint. In sparring, you are using controlled moves; controlled in such a way that you don't do damage to the other Pokémon, but you are still using the move. See how it ties up to what I said earlier about training? Anyway, your Pokémon get better with the skill being practiced, and the other Pokémon is also getting stronger because it is "defending" against your attacks. You're mutually benefiting from this setup. Of course, this is not as effective as being in actual battles, but the effect is pretty noticeable. And then, you can choose the third option: obtaining a Z-ring. You can easily find a Z-ring in the Alola region, or so I've been told, and wielding a Z-ring gives your Pokémon a powerful move tied in with the Z-ring. But that's quite the easy way out, isn't it? Anyway, that concludes my lecture. Did you catch all of that, Orendi, or do you want me to repeat it all over again?</state>

It's said to lurk in another world... A world on the opposite side of ours...It's said that in the Distortion World, neither time nor space were stable. I think that tells us something about Giratina, the only Pokémon there. It must have been as powerful as Dialga and Palkia, the rulers of time and space. In some way, though, Giratina has to have a power opposite of theirs. I'm sorry this is so long. May I say one last bit? Dialga's Roar of Time...Palkia's Spacial Rend...To the people back then, those Pokémon really must have appeared to rule over time and space. Seeing them must have shaken the people to their very core. Those feelings of awe, wonder, and everything else. It passed that memory to countless people, eventually becoming a myth...That's what I believe as a researcher of myths. I think I let myself get carried away and talked for far too long. I'm sorry, and thank you.</state>

                <state img="#-fingerup.png" marker="YuriIntro3">{big}When this world was made, Dialga and Palkia appeared. Apparently, there was one more Pokémon that appeared at the same time. A Pokémon with as much power as Dialga and Palkia... But also one whose name was never to be spoken--Giratina! It's said to lurk in another world... A world on the opposite side of ours... According to an ancient document, time, space, and antimatter, or what combined we call the world, shall be born when Arceus stands on the Mystri Stage. This is where one might say, "The lead enters the Mystri Stage at last." All my study of ruins and Pokémon mythology in Sinnoh may have been to bring you up on this stage here today... Depicted on the Mystri Stage are the Pokémon that shaped this world. The circle in the middle is Arceus, the origin of it all... </state>
                <state img="#-fingerup.png" marker="YuriIntro3">This cave painting...It's always been described this way. The light in the center represents either Dialga or Palkia appearing at the Spear Pillar. The three lights around it were thought to be Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. May I continue? But, then, I realized that there may be another way of interpreting this. Could this triangle of lights actually represent a different trio? Could they be Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina instead? And the large light at their center. Does it represent something else? Could it be what created this world of ours? May I continue for a little bit longer? Thank you for listening to my theory. Do you know of the ancient Plates they find all over Sinnoh? One of them had this engraved on it. Two beings of time and space set free from the Original One. I think this quote, too, points to the presence of another Pokémon. A Pokémon even more powerful than Dialga or Palkia. Does that sound plausible to you? I'm not quite sure how Giratina fits into this scheme of things, but... It's said that in the Distortion World, neither time nor space were stable. I think that tells us something about Giratina, the only Pokémon there. It must have been as powerful as Dialga and Palkia, the rulers of time and space. In some way, though, Giratina has to have a power opposite of theirs. I'm sorry this is so long. May I say one last bit? A long time ago, I wonder what sort of person painted this? Dialga's Roar of Time...Palkia's Spacial Rend...To the people back then, those Pokémon really must have appeared to rule over time and space. Seeing them must have shaken the people to their very core. This painting represents those feelings of awe, wonder, and everything else. It passed that memory to countless people, eventually becoming a myth...That's what I believe as a researcher of myths. I think I let myself get carried away and talked for far too long. I'm sorry, and thank you.</state>
