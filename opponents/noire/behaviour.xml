It produces a lot of video games targeted at a casual player, which are popular among children, too... Are you listening to me, ~aiopp~?</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="smaller">What are dogoos? Slimy creatures with some canine features: Part dog, part goo. Usually, they're cute and do almost no harm aside from shamelessly licking people, but they're able to merge to form larger and stronger ones. There are dogoos with slimy tentacles too, which are much more dangerous.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="smaller">If goddesses such as Vert and me ruled Earth, it could become a very peaceful place.  Don't you agree, ~player~? There are no creatures as powerful as dragons, phoenixes, or flying whales here, and machines and robots are so primitive that they present no danger either.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="smaller">Each country in Gamindustri has its specialty foods, chosen by the goddesses. Maybe you've heard about Planeptune's pudding, Lowee's manjuu, Leanbox's mushrooms, and Lastation's curry. I cook fine curry myself... but don't imagine I'll &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; cook for you, ~player~.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="smaller">Where Vert gets her tea from? I doubt all the varieties she drinks are grown in Leanbox. Could it be she actually imports it from other worlds? Maybe even from Earth? Using transdimensional portals just to buy tea seems like a waste of share energy to me, but I know her well enough not to be surprised if it's true.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="small">Neptune is pretty skilled with her katana, but her fighting style is wild and strength-based. I much prefer to watch Nepgear's moves, which are more dance-like and elegant. Maybe she learned that by observing me?</state>
                <state img="custom:#-explaining" marker="NoireLoreSaid" font-size="smaller">Apparently, Neptune stays slim despite eating so much pudding and snacks by transforming repeatedly into and out of her Hard Drive Divinity form. It does burn calories faster than normal workout, but is uses up a lot of share energy too.  She's unbelievably irresponsible.</state>
