I imagine that they'd all be rather embarrassing, though I'd believe my time as an adolescent to be the most... &lt;i&gt;destructive&lt;/i&gt;.</state>
                <state img="#-complain.png" oneShotId="467" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">I've heard salacious rumors about "oh what raunchy things that Turandot must do locked in her palace with all those women at her beck and call." And... do they think that's what happens at all jobs? I'm an employer. Being seduced by your boss is not in the job description.</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Being in public and not having to either roam incognito nor beat away suitors, I am almost unsure of what to do with myself. I have let those men define me for so long...</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" oneShotId="2910" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">I wish I could convince some of my staff to do uproarious events like a poker night. Shame is that I am their boss. It's uncomfortable. It could even ultimately end up with a less effective work environment or blatant favoritism. &lt;i&gt;Sigh.&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-complain.png" oneShotId="2912" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">I'm unsure what to think about girls "going wild" when perceived to want sex. I can't say I don't appreciate the idea of being liberated nor feeling so free, yet I can't shake that it sounds like it's another state. Am I not able to be horny yet stay civil?</state>
                <state img="#-abrasive.png" oneShotId="589" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Sometimes I feel it's all gone straight to my hips. Granted, a fully staffed kitchen team has helped to keep me &lt;i&gt;rather&lt;/i&gt; trim, but it doesn't help that I can demand someone make a cake at any hour and they immediately start doing it.</state>
                <state img="#-haughty.png" oneShotId="2911" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Now, some might conclude that my rather derisive behavior towards men and seeming delight I might take in that behavior &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; mean I get some... &lt;i&gt;excitement&lt;/i&gt; in their humiliation. To which I say: how &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; you make such accusations against me!</state>
                <state img="#-talking.png" oneShotId="658" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Now, how about some dates filled with almond paste and a nice jasmine tea? Hmm? Oh. &lt;i&gt;Sigh&lt;/i&gt;. Not a lady-in-waiting in sight.</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">It may be time to move on from the single life, not that there haven't been previous attempts. The liberty of the bachelorette is not nearly lost on me, but the absence of another who cares for me weighs too heavily on my mind.</state>
                <state img="#-bored.png" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Well, at the very least I don't have to sit in this chair "correctly." Noble society's opinion that &lt;i&gt;sitting&lt;/i&gt; be more indicative of class and character than &lt;i&gt;ethics&lt;/i&gt; continues to astound me.</state>
                <state img="#-talking.png" oneShotId="1842" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Suitors have said that they need me, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually as well. Do they not realize how that's &lt;i&gt;much worse&lt;/i&gt;? That's a lot of responsibility for someone you've only just met. And what if I simply don't care about you? What then?</state>
                <state img="#-talking.png" oneShotId="2680" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">I'm rather sick of the hero, princess, and dragon trio in stories. I think we've explored every avenue of that combination. Dragon saves princess from hero, the hero is the princess, that they're all in a polyamorous relationship... It's truly just run its course.</state>
                <state img="#-sarcastic.png" oneShotId="2850" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">What do you think is more frightening? A confession of love with plans for how you will both lead your lives from then on, made completely without your input. Or a confession with no plans, a life that is propelled by that love and nothing else.</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" oneShotId="2866" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">When you begin to date someone, you don't have years of history. There are not yet small signals that can read "I love you". No look into their eyes can give you that total reassurance. You are open and bare. Quite frightening.</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" oneShotId="2908" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">More than anything, people want a partner that they can feel safe with, who they never feel the urge to back away from. Though it's not entirely something that can be controlled by either party.</state>
                <state img="#-dumbfounded.png" oneShotId="3236" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Do you want me to be your &lt;i&gt;mommy&lt;/i&gt;? If you thought yes... consider this less of an opportunity to indulge in your &lt;i&gt;desires&lt;/i&gt; and more to imply you might want to seek a counselor.</state>
                <state img="#-dumbfounded.png" oneShotId="3237" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Sometimes, before issuing them away, I ask my suitors "What is it about me that attracts you so?" The answers they give... some are &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt; but others, well, they just show that they... &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt; weren't paying &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; attention at all during our conversation.</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" oneShotId="3284" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Maybe I could find someone who would hold me and tell me they loved me... But they could never love me as much as they love the image of me in their mind...</state>
                <state img="#-weakness.png" oneShotId="3314" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">...I think I miss my governess. I don't know why, but she popped in my mind for the briefest second. Maybe I still yearn for those days of innocence when my greatest responsibility was not dirtying my new dress before an important dinner.</state>
                <state img="#-sarcastic.png" oneShotId="3685" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">Sometimes you cannot stop the tide, but you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; redirect it. So, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you do wind up touching yourself to my image tonight... &lt;i&gt;sigh...&lt;/i&gt; Would you please not have my imaginary self do anything overly weird or degrading. I have an image to maintain.</state>
                <state img="#-sarcastic.png" oneShotId="3795" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">I've often heard rejected suitors mumbling any number of heinous terms for same-sex attraction. My own thoughts of the lovely women of the world aside, it troubles me that they could not reach the possibility that they might simply be an un-datable asshole...</state>
                <state img="#-complain.png" oneShotId="3874" weight="4" collectible="croc_plush" collectible-value="+1">A word to those who will hear it: do not flirt with someone who cannot leave. A cute worker or the person hosting an event cannot remove themselves if they are made uncomfortable. Unlike, say, us here. We can leave whenever we please. &lt;i&gt;Myself included.&lt;/i&gt;</state>
