        <title>Turandot's Chair</title>
        <subtitle>Because thrones are hard to move</subtitle>
        <text>The chair appears to be regal, imposing, and adorned in the finest fabric. It is quite firm at first, almost uncomfortable to sit in despite its beauty. However, upon spending more time together, you find it to be more soft and giving than you expected. Perhaps with some hard work and patience you and her... I mean, you and the chair, might form a mutual bond.</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Turandot.</unlock>
