        <title>Super Saiyan 4</title>
        <subtitle>A Saiyan connected to their primal roots.</subtitle>
        <text>"Oh hell yeah! I can't believe how powerful I feel right now! I don't get why my pants changed color, and I'm gonna need a top, I don't wanna be floppin' around everywhere when I fight. And... the tail, yeah, that's super weird. Still, I feel incredible! And y'know what? I've got you to thank for this. Hey, I'm serious! You've inspired me to push my limits, and you're seein' the results right now. Until next time, buddy!"</text>
        <unlock>A Saiyan gets stronger every time they're defeated, and you've defeated Caulifla four times in battle, unlocking the Super Saiyan 4 achievement as a result. </unlock>
