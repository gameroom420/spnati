    <description>Colress is a Pokemon researcher and the co-leader of Team Plasma, despite his open hatred of Ghestis and his dismissal of the team's goals. He instead seeks to unlock the true potential of a Pokemon...regardless of how dirty his hands need to get. Despite that, he's known to be especially cheerful and helpful.</description>
