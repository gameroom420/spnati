        <subtitle>Zombie Slayers' Romance</subtitle>
        <text>To my outlander date
Despite our molten origins
We cool, together, upon 
a shared deathly fate

This card is a symbol of a ritual 
of love and lust, and admiration
I hope your firearms and my flaming
armaments bind us again eternal

Stir at my heart
Join me in Teyvat
Betwixt strange worlds
Inspire my arts

Be my Valentine, and be mine, Leon...</text>
        <unlock>Defeat Hu Tao in her "Pyretic Passion" outfit following her asking Leon out on a date in a previous game. [Leon must also have lost in that game.] </unlock>
