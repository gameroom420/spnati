    <description>Hailing from the town of Vale, Jenna is a villager who trained and studied Psynergy after having believed to have lost her family in a tragedy when she was 14. She would later be kidnapped alongside Kraden, a scholar, with her thought-to-be-dead brother, Felix, by those who wished to destroy the world. She, along with Felix and co., would rejoin Issac and his party later into their journey to save the world from its impending doom.</description>
