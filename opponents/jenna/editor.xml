    <othernotes>- Jenna, like Mia, uses Psynergy. In a meta sense, Psynergy is a JRPG magic system that uses four elements, and is based on the power of the mind (made distinct from another source of power, Chi, which is 'the power of the body'). &lt;br&gt;- Psynergy is based on four elements; Venus (Earth), Mars (Fire), Jupiter (Wind) and Mercury (Water).&lt;br&gt;- People who can use Psynergy are called Adepts. Jenna is a Mars Adept.&lt;br&gt;- Mars is associated with some of the strongest attack magic in the series. Along with Garet, both possess powerful magic early on. Jenna, in the late game, can become a wielder of both powerful attack and healing magic based on her Djinn setup.&lt;br&gt;- Psynergy is treated like psychic powers/PSI - only other Adepts can see Psynergy being used, non-Adepts can only see the effects (e.g. a boulder being moved, water appearing out of nowhere). For the sake of targeted interactions in SPNATI, this limitation can be ignored.&lt;br&gt;- She is written as if three years have passed since Alchemy returned to Weyard (the ending of Golden Sun: The Lost Age). She is mentioned in Dark Dawn, which is set decades after TLA, but is not seen. She is married to Issac and has a son named Matthew with him, but this will be before she is set in such feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Random Trivia&lt;br&gt;- Jenna is the only female character who can use a sword, but can also wield a staff. What she lacks in any outling stats, she makes up with her versatility and various builds. Can't go wrong with a jack-of-all-trades!</othernotes>
