                <state img="#-Smug.png" marker="megumin_name_resp">I actually go by many names, Arch-Wizard. My current name, &lt;i&gt;Toyosatomimi no Miko&lt;/i&gt;, was the one I chose upon my resurrection in Gensokyo. I am most commonly known as &lt;i&gt;Prince Shoutoku&lt;/i&gt; in the outside world, though that name did not come into being until after my apparent death. My birth name was &lt;i&gt;Umayado&lt;/i&gt;, for I was born outside a stable door. A man’s name, so I see no reason to continue using it in this day and age. {small} Prince &lt;i&gt;Kamistumiya&lt;/i&gt; was another name I’ve been known by, as is &lt;i&gt;Toyotomimi&lt;/i&gt;. The latter I liked enough to repurpose as the family name for my new, immortal body. The chronicle of legends known as the &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt;  names me as &lt;i&gt;Kamitsumiya no Umayado no Toyotomimi no Mikoto&lt;/i&gt;. An accurate name, but a mouthful. I have also been known as &lt;i&gt;Toyotomimi no Nori no Ōkami&lt;/i&gt; or more simply &lt;i&gt;Nori no Ushi no Ōkami&lt;/i&gt;. Those are more titles than formal names, however. &lt;i&gt;Toyotomimi no Nori no Ōkami&lt;/i&gt; loosely translates to “Toyosatomimi Ear Method King”, a reference to my ability to hear ten conversations at once but somewhat awkward-sounding. Does that answer your question, Arch-Wizard? If not, I can direct you to the historical tome &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, which records all my titles and deeds…</state>
