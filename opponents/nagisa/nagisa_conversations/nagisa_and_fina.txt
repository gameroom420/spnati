If Nagisa to left and Fina to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_nothing_fancy]*: It's me? Okay! Just don't be too disappointed, because I'm not really wearing anything fancy.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply1]*: Well, I don't see any reason you should have to, ~nagisa~... In fact, it seems a little silly to worry about your attire when the point of coming here is to remove it.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_makeup]*: I just didn't know anyone was going to dress up. Maybe I could have borrowed some makeup off my mom. She said I could if I was going somewhere special.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue1]* [requires Default Outfit]: Well, that's certainly something you <i>could</i> do, if you wanted to... but there's something to be said for just coming as you are. I'm only wearing these clothes because they bring back pleasant memories...
-- (Cipher) Note: I'll probably need to make an alt case for this if Fina gets any alternate outfits. It's likely to only need a few modifications though, as I don't think Fina would wear an outfit purely to be presentable to others.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_pleasant_memories_default]*: I guess for me, it's my uniform that brings back pleasant memories. Sometimes it feels like I'm <i>always</i> wearing it!
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd1]* [requires Default Outfit]: In that case, ~nagisa~, I think your uniform was exactly the right choice... And, if you're concerned that you're wearing it too much, perhaps removing it with us will even help you feel better about that.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_helpful]*: It's me? Okay! I'm happy to help in any way I can.
Fina [NagisaWaitressFinaReply1]*: You're so thoughtful, ~nagisa~, dressing up for us like this... May I order, um... one pair of shoes? Is that how this works?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_shoes]*: One pair of shoes, coming right up! Hehe!
Fina [NagisaWaitressFinaReplyContinue1]*: Haha... oh, my, such prompt service. Thank you so much... You can just put them wherever you'd like.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_anything_else]*: Let me know if there's anything else at all I can help you with!
Fina [NagisaWaitressFinaReplyEnd1]*: Of course, ~nagisa~... And the same to you, for that matter. Regardless of your outfit, you're here to enjoy yourself too, right?


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS AND FINA'S FIRST TIME:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_ryou]*: I probably should have practised more with Ryou before I tried this. I don't really have any experience playing a game like this.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply2Stranger]*: Actually, neither do I, ~nagisa~... This is my first time playing, and I didn't even practice. So, at least you'll have an advantage over me...

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_the_rules]*: Maybe we should go over the rules one last time. Just to make sure Fina and I know what we're doing.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue2Stranger]*: Well, I wouldn't mind that... though I'm not personally worried about it. It's... actually sort of a fun intellectual challenge to figure things out as I go.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_work_it_out]*: I can try to work how to play better as we go along if that's what everyone else is doing. Do you think it's going to get more difficult?
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd2Stranger]*: Perhaps so, ~nagisa~, but... much more exciting as well, I'm hoping...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_learn_from_mistakes]*: You've probably worked it out by now, but I don't really know what I'm doing. But I'd like to learn from my mistakes if anyone is willing to teach me.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply2Friend]*: If it makes you feel better, ~nagisa~, I don't have much experience either. I've played before once or twice, but I'm certainly no expert... perhaps we'll be evenly matched.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor) AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_helping]*: Maybe we could help each other, Fina. Although to be honest, I think you'd be helping me more than I'd be helping you...
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue2Friend]*: I really don't mind if you're the one who benefits most... I'm not sure how to cooperate in a game like this, but perhaps we can just be here for each other, if things get difficult.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor) AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_difficult]*: Haha, thanks! Yeah, I think things are only going to get more difficult!
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd2Friend]*: Maybe so, ~nagisa~, but... they'll be much more exciting as well, I think. Frightening things can also be... wonderful...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_poker_noob]*: I'm sorry if I'm not very good at this. I haven't really played much poker... especially this kind.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply2Close]*: Don't worry, ~nagisa~... When I first started coming here, I don't think I even knew the rules, but I figured it out soon enough. You'll probably get used to it faster than you think...

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor) AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_finish_for_sure]*: I'll finish this game for sure. But I can't promise I'll play again, so I don't know if I'll get used to it, Fina.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue2Close]*: Oh, well, of course. If you don't enjoy it this time, there's no reason you need to continue playing... Although I suppose you could also play regular poker, without the stripping.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor) AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_regular_poker]*: Do you think it's too late to see if everyone wants to play regular poker?
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd2CloseEarly]*: Well... we've only just started, so I suppose we could ask. Personally, I like the stripping, but... I <i>do</i> want to try ordinary poker sometime, as well... -- If not many rounds have passed in the game, maybe 5 or fewer.
OR
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd2CloseLate]*: I don't know, ~nagisa~... We've already been playing this way for a while, so it seems a bit late for that. I'd be alright with it if you stopped stripping and kept track of your score some other way, though... --Otherwise.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_dress_in_layers]*: Oh, my turn again? It's okay. I usually dress in layers because I get cold easily.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply3]*: Oh, ~nagisa~? I also get cold easily... But, maybe that's my fault for <i>not</i> dressing in layers... I'm just not used to it. Is it comfortable to wear that many?

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cold_winters]*: It can be comfy, especially in a big coat and mittens. But mostly I try to dress warm because some winters I get sick if I get too cold.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue3]*: Oh, I see... Well, then it makes sense that you're careful to stay warm! Have you fallen seriously ill that way before?

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_got_sick]*: I missed a lot of days of school last year because I got sick. But I should be okay today, I hope.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd3Cold]*: Well, just let me know if you're getting too cold, alright? If you lose a lot of clothing and feel uncomfortably chilly, I'd be happy to share body heat with you...
OR
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd3]*: Yes, it doesn't seem too cold here, so hopefully you're right. Just let me know if you're having trouble, and I'll do whatever I can to help...
OR
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd3Hot]*: Yes, it's so hot here that I doubt you'll be cold even if you end up completely nude... I'm glad we decided to play somewhere warm. It seems very appropriate for this game...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_dont_laugh]*: Me? Um, you ~player.ifMale(guys|girls)~ won't laugh, will you?
Fina [NagisaFinaReply4]*: I promise I won't laugh at you, ~nagisa~, whatever it is you're concerned about. Even if you're hiding a Looper under your shirt, or you have dinner plates on your chest instead of a bra...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_girly_bra]*: D-dinner plates?! No, I just mean, my bra is kind of pink and girly... It's not... I mean, I bought it not really thinking other people would ever see it.
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue4]*: Well, that sounds much less silly than the dinner plates, so I doubt anyone will laugh... And, part of what's exciting about this game is... well, showing things we wouldn't normally show, right?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_no_mature_bra]*: I'm sorry if you were hoping to see something more, um... mature...
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd4]*: I don't see anything immature about it, ~nagisa~... and it seems silly to assign maturity to clothes, anyway. It's pretty and colorful, and I like it...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_dont_tell_dad]*: Ah! Um, you can never tell my dad I was here, okay?
Fina [NagisaFinaReply5]*: Well, of course I won't tell him if you don't want me to ~nagisa~... Do you think he'd be upset with you if he found out?

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_picnic]*: One time when I was on a picnic, a boy tried to look up my skirt... My dad chased him for an hour...
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue5]*: Ah... I see... Well, no one should look up your skirt without your permission, but... that does sound a bit extreme. Does... he restrict what you can do a great deal?

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_adult_stuff]*: I know he's just trying to protect me. But I'm an adult now, so I have to do adult stuff eventually, right?
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd5]*: I hope you're right that he has your best interests at heart... Personally, I'd rather have freedom than safety. If you're not allowed to live the way you want, then... you've already lost your life...


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_take_me_seriously]*: Ah! N-Nobody will take me seriously as an adult if I back out now. But you don't need to worry about me. I believe in myself.
Fina [NagisaFinaReply6]*: I think there are plenty of adults who don't do anything like this, ~nagisa~, but... I won't dissuade you. I can tell you're determined to see this through, no matter what...

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_big_breasts]*: And n-not every woman has big breasts, you know!
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue6]*: Yes, and it would be petty to judge someone's body based on something like that. Breasts of all sizes are beautiful... You agree with me, right, ~player~?

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_think_about_boobs]: <i>(Did Fina just ask ~player~ to think about my boobs?! What if ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ hates them? I really hope ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ doesn't hate them...)</i>
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd6]*: Um... are you all right, ~nagisa~? Did I say something wrong...? I'm so sorry, I didn't intend to make you uncomfortable... -- I'm assuming there's some sort of posing clue that Nagisa is stressing out here.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_wedding_night]*: Does anybody else think maybe a girl should wait until her wedding night before she goes all the way?
Fina [NagisaFinaReply7]*: I don't know, ~nagisa~... If you're going to undress for someone in a special ceremony, isn't it better to have some practice first? Though, I admit, I'm not very knowledgeable about weddings...

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_future_spouse]*: I-I hope my future ~player.ifMale(husband|partner)~ will understand!
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyContinue7]*: Would it really be that upsetting to ~player.ifMale(him|them)~? Surely it's unreasonable to expect someone to only show themselves to a single person... What if you had more than one ~player.ifMale(husband|partner)~?

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_multiple_partners]*: M-More than one ~player.ifMale(husband|partner)~?!
Fina [NagisaFinaReplyEnd7]*: Um... well, couldn't you? Is that some sort of taboo where you're from? I guess I haven't seen many others do that, but I don't see what would be wrong with it... I'm sorry, I'm just very confused about this...

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_no_love]*: When two people love each other very much, there are some things that are special just between them. It's just that no ~player.ifMale(boy|one)~ has ever said ~player.ifMale(he loves|they love)~ me... 
Fina [NagisaFinaPolyamory]*: Oh, I'm sure someone will someday,  ~nagisa~.  But, I still don't see the need for the restriction... Every friend also represents something special between two people, but you can have more than one friend, right?

---

FINA MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_princess]*: Your jewelry is so pretty, Miss Fina. Are you a princess? Sh-should I be curtseying?
Fina [FinaNagisaReply1]*: No, I'm not a princess, ~nagisa~, and you certainly don't need to curtsey... I'm actually an Air Pirate, believe it or not, though I know I don't look much like one.

FINA STRIPPING BOOTS (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_air_pirate]*: Oh, an Air Pirate?! Are you sure I shouldn't curtsey?! Or bow? I don't want to get in trouble with a pirate! I'll be good!
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyContinue1]*: No, don't worry! I'm a Blue Rogue, and Blue Rogues don't attack anyone who doesn't deserve it. Unless you start harming innocent people or robbing unarmed merchant ships, you have nothing to fear from me...

FINA STRIPPED BOOTS (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_policewoman]: Oh, so you're more like a policewoman?
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyEnd1]*: Um... perhaps? But I believe police work on behalf of a government, while the Blue Rogues directly opposed the Valuan government when it was corrupt. That's probably why we're considered pirates...


FINA MUST STRIP HEADDRESS:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_your_highness]*: I'm sorry, your highness!
Fina [FinaNagisaReply2]*: I promise, ~nagisa~, I'm really not any sort of royalty... I wouldn't even want to be, honestly. It's difficult for anyone to hold that sort of power without being corrupted by it...

FINA STRIPPING HEADDRESS (accessory): [requires previous case]
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_prince]*: Sorry. You told me that, but I forgot. I thought every girl dreamed about being a princess, or about marrying a prince.
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyContinue2]*: Perhaps most do, but when I was young, the Elders taught me how the ancient royal families and other rulers caused endless strife with their pointless wars, and... I just never wanted to be part of that.

FINA STRIPPED HEADDRESS (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_good_princess]*: I think you'd make a good princess, Fina. You have a good head on your shoulders, so I don't think you'd be corrupted by it.
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyEnd2]*: That's very kind of you to say, ~nagisa~... I hope you're right, but I'd rather not risk it. I'd much rather live freely as an Air Pirate, and impose my will on no one, justly or otherwise...


FINA MUST STRIP SLEEVES:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_how_old]*: Um, if it's not too rude of me to ask... How old are you, Fina?
Fina [FinaNagisaReply3]*: It's not rude at all to ask, ~nagisa~... I'm eighteen now. Though, I spent so much of that time sitting around in the Great Silver Shrine that... Well, it feels odd to think about being that age.

FINA STRIPPING SLEEVES (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_homebody]*: Oh! I'm eighteen too! Don't feel bad if you've been a bit of a homebody growing up. You've got your whole life ahead of you!
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyContinue3]*: Yes, you're right, and that's the attitude I try to have about it. But, sometimes I feel like I'm trying to squeeze in as many new experiences as I can, just to make up for---ah... Hold on a moment...

FINA STRIPPED SLEEVES (minor): Cupil revealed
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_little_robot]*: Ah, is that a little robot?
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyEnd3]*: Something like that... He's an artificial creature who can change his shape. He's usually a bracelet on my arm... {Cupil}[Chirp!]{!reset} Anyway, if nothing else, at least I've always had his company...

FINA HAND AFTER STRIPPED SLEEVES:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_adorable]*: He's so adorable! Like a floating silver dango! Hello, little guy.
Fina [FinaNagisaCupil]*: Cupil, say hi back to ~nagisa~? {Cupil}[Chirp, chirp!]{!reset} I'm glad you like him, I think he likes you too...


FINA MUST STRIP DRESS:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_misunderstanding]*: Oh no! Is it time for little Cupil to leave us already?
Fina [FinaNagisaReply4]*: No, Cupil's not going anywhere, ~nagisa~... I <i>could</i> count him as an accessory---{Cupil}[Chirp?]{!reset}---but I've already "stripped" him off my arm, and... it seems unfair to stall any longer...

FINA STRIPPING DRESS (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_hide_eyes]*: Oh? Ohhhhh... Cupil, let's hide our eyes, okay?
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyContinue4]*: {Cupil}[Chirp?]{!reset} Oh, Cupil needs to do that least of all... He's been with me ever since I was a little girl, and I dress and bathe in front of him all the time... Though, really, it's fine for <i>anyone</i> to look...

FINA STRIPPED DRESS (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_camcorder]*: H-He doesn't have a camcorder inside him, does he?! Cupil wouldn't record you in the bath, would he?
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyEnd4]*: Maybe he could record the sound of me in the bath, but I'm not sure why he would unless I asked him to. Cupil can act on his own, but he's mostly designed to support me and follow my instructions...

FINA HAND AFTER STRIPPED DRESS:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_cassettes]*: You have to tell Cupil that it's never okay to make tapes of you doing private stuff! What if people started copying cassettes of things they shouldn't hear from to~background.time~?
Fina [FinaNagisaCupilCassettes]*: I promise it's okay, ~nagisa~... Cupil doesn't make tapes, or anything physical someone else could use on their own. And he wouldn't do something like that without my permission anyway, would you, Cupil? {Cupil}[Chirp!]{!reset}


FINA MUST STRIP LEGGINGS:
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_no_hope]*: It looks as though there's no hope left, Fina. Will you be okay?
Fina [FinaNagisaReply5]*: No hope? That's a rather dismal way of putting it... Please, don't worry, ~nagisa~. I've been in far more difficult situations than this... Not that it's not still embarrassing, of course...

FINA STRIPPING LEGGINGS (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_if_wishes_were_real]*: If wishes were real, I'd still use mine to save you.
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyContinue5]*: But, I don't want to be saved... You can't be respected as an Air Pirate if you keep running from battles. And, even then... I wouldn't want to let go of this feeling, the way my heart is racing...

FINA STRIPPED LEGGINGS (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_respect]*: I still respect you, even though you lost this fight.
Fina [FinaNagisaReplyEnd5]*: Well, thank you, ~nagisa~... But, I haven't lost just yet. Vyse taught me never to give up, and even if it's only a strip poker game... as long as I have cards to play, I won't surrender!

---
DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Fina to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart1]: ~Nagisa~, you seem a little nervous about this game. Is it your first time trying something like this?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_start_1]: Um, yeah. Is it that obvious, Fina? Should I leave? I'm probably not good at this kind of thing anyway...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue1]: No, no, you don't have to leave... I'm so sorry, I didn't intend that to be a criticism. It's just something I thought we might have in common... since I'm quite new to this game myself...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_continue_1]: Oh, you are?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) DEFAULT UNIFORM:
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd1Stranger]: Yes, this is actually my very first time playing a game like this. I'm a little nervous myself, but I'm also excited... and I want both of us to have a good time here, so let's do this together...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_nervous_together]: We can be nervous together then. I'm glad you're here, Fina.
OR
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd1Friend]: Yes, I've attended these games in the past, but it wasn't so long ago that I was in your position. And, I want both of us to have a good time here... so, let's do this together...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_positive_attitude]: Thanks, Fina! You have such a positive attitude.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Fina [FinaNagisaWaitressStart1]*: I like your outfit, ~nagisa~... You have a job as a waitress, right? Aika and I worked as waitresses in Nasrad for a few weeks... It was quite fun, as long as the customers weren't too rowdy.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_rowdy]*: Thank you so much, Fina! Yeah, this is my dress for work. It's a family restaurant, so we have our fair share of rowdy kids too!

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory) WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Fina [FinaNagisaWaitressContinue1]*: Oh, I see... It was sailors and Air Pirates that we had to contend with, so it was a different sort of rowdiness... but, I imagine children must cause plenty of trouble as well.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_kids]*: They're all so precious, so the manager lets them get away with a lot! -- a cute happy pose

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory) WAITRESS OUTFIT:
Fina [FinaNagisaWaitressEnd1]*: Haha... Perhaps it's just because I haven't known many children before, but... that sounds quite nice. I don't think I'd mind that sort of trouble...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_waitress_feel_lucky]*: When the kids bow and say thank you, I feel so lucky to be working there!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart2]: So, I'm curious to know... why were you interested in coming to this place, ~nagisa~? Did you just want to explore the new... experiences... that one can have here?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_not_very_popular]: Well, I'm not very popular, so...

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue2]: Hmmm... are you saying you wanted to come here to increase your popularity? Is strip poker considered an admirable pastime among your peers, then?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_inspired]*: Actually, I would be really embarrassed if anyone from school recognized me here, Fina. But a girl I know is really good at games and really brave, and I was inspired by her!
     OR [nagisa_fina_inspired_kyou]*: I don't know if I'd call it admirable... But a girl I know is really good at games and really brave, and I was inspired by her! Kyou probably knows who I mean.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd2]*: Oh, is that so? I'm so happy she was able to inspire you like that... what is her name?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_tomoyo]: Her name is Tomoyo Sakagami. She just transferred to my school, but she's already running for Student Council President.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET: [requires previous case]
Fina [FinaNagisaStart3]*: So, ~nagisa~... may I ask what exactly a "Student Council President" does? Or, for that matter... I'm not entirely sure what a "Student Council" is, either...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_student_council]*: A Student Council is a group of students at the school who make all of the important decisions, and the President is their boss. I don't really know a lot about it, but they work hard.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue3]*: I see... so your school has its own government of sorts, run by students? How fascinating... Are there also rebel students, who oppose the Council's decisions?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_delinquent_students]: Yeah, there are some delinquent students who don't want to following the rules, but Sakagami is a really good fighter, so they don't cause much trouble anymore.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd3]*: Oh, my... Then, Sakagami relies on strength of arms to enforce the Council's will? Well, I suppose that's sometimes necessary, but... by itself, it doesn't seem like the best approach in the long term...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_non-violence]*: Yeah. Personally, I believe in finding non-violent solutions.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT AND FINA CLOTHED:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart4Clothed]*: Are you still doing alright, ~nagisa~? You're, um, pulling ahead of me a bit... I hope that's not too disconcerting.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_shirt_okay]*: Me? I'm... okay.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major) AND FINA CLOTHED:
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue4Clothed]*: Will it help if I look away until you're finished? You can also stop if you need to, of course, but if you're planning to keep going...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_shirt_clothed]*: Y-Yeah, I think that would help, Fina. Thanks for being so nice.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major) AND FINA CLOTHED:
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd4Clothed]*: Alright, I'm not looking, ~nagisa~. Let me know when you're ready... -- I'll probably use her shy pose which thanks to the position detection, should in fact always be looking away from Nagisa here, I believe!
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_take_it_slow]*: Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm still kinda nervous, so I'd like it if we could take it kind of slow from here.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT AND FINA EXPOSED:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart4Exposed]*: Are you still doing alright, ~nagisa~? Things are starting to... um... progress a bit, so I'd like to be sure...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_shirt_nervous]*: Um, I'm feeling really nervous about this, to be honest. Everyone's looking at me.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major) AND FINA EXPOSED:
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue4Exposed]*: Hmm, I see... Everyone, why don't you look at my body for a moment instead, so she can ease into this? I'll gladly let you have a better view of whatever most interests you...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_shirt_exposed]*: F-Fina! Don't look at Fina, everyone! Look at me! Um, I have a pretty pink bra under here that you'll all like! It's really, um... s-sexy!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major) AND FINA EXPOSED:
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd4Exposed]*: Oh, ~nagisa~, you don't have to do that... I really don't mind them looking, and I think they're just looking at both of us now. But, perhaps it's better to get it over with anyway... -- This will use her giggling pose, for context.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_friend]*: I can't believe you did that for me, Fina. You're right that they're just looking at both of us anyway... but I guess I can endure it with a friend like you by my side.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT AND FINA EXPOSED IN 3-PLAYER GAME:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart4Exposed3Players]*: Are you still doing alright, ~nagisa~? It'll just be me and ~player~ watching, if that helps at all...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_another_pair]*: I'll just think of you two as ~player.ifMale(like my mom and dad|like two girls watching me in the changing rooms)~. Wait, no, that's way too weird. Um...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major) AND FINA EXPOSED IN 3-PLAYER GAME:
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue4Exposed3Players]*: Hmm... ~Player~, why don't you look at my body right now instead of hers? I'll make sure not to cover myself, so you can see whatever you'd like...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_are_interested]*: Oh! A-Are you interested in ~player~ in that way, Fina? Does ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ know? Gosh! Oh, no! It was a secret, wasn't it? I'm so sorry!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major) AND FINA EXPOSED IN 3-PLAYER GAME:
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd4Exposed3Players]*: Oh, don't worry, ~nagisa~... I was just hoping it would take the pressure off you. I'm not sure what I feel for ~player~ yet, but... if I was, I'd be happy for ~player.ifMale(him|her)~ to know about it...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_saying_too_much]*: Sorry for jumping to conclusions, Fina. I just can't think too straight right now, and ~player.ifMale(he's so handsome|she's so beautiful)~, and I'm saying way too much so I might just be quiet again for a bit.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major) AND FINA EXPOSED IN 3-PLAYER GAME AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd4Exposed3PlayersClose]*: Oh, I don't think it's any secret by now that I find ~player~ quite... intriguing. I was just trying to draw attention away from you, in case you'd be more comfortable...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_chaperone]*: I see... I guess I'm kind of like your chaperone then. Although chaperones aren't normally supposed to take their shirts off...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart5]*: Alright, ~nagisa~... What can I do to help you through this? I'll happily support you however I can...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_sing_with_me]*: W-Would you sing with me? I think I can do this with a smile if we could sing quietly...

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue5]*: Well, I haven't done much singing in the past, but I can do my best... Would you be able to start, so I can see how it goes?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_singing_start]*: [song note] <i>Dango, dango, dango...</i> [song note]

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd5]*: [song note] <i>Dango, dango...</i> [song note] -- It's a very simple but adorably cute song. I put this here to take out the guesswork, but you can adjust if desired.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_singing_end]*: [song note] <i>Big dango family!</i> [song note]<br>Thank you, everyone. I'm sorry if I'm still a bit too shy, but I'm working it.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart6]*: Oh, my... So we're at this point already... You know, you're really brave to have made it this far, ~nagisa~...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_not_brave]*: No, I don't deserve any praise. I'm not as brave as I look. I'm just closing my eyes and hoping I don't lose again.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue6]*: But, you're staying with us, despite how nervous you clearly are about... um, going this far... Continuing to act even in the face of your fears is the definition of courage, isn't it?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_so_sudden]*: What? It's my turn?! But this is so sudden! I... I can't... I can do this!

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd6]*: I'm so sorry, ~nagisa~... I didn't realize you hadn't noticed. You don't have to---oh! See, that's what I mean when I say you're brave. Even though you weren't prepared, you managed to...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_quick_strip]*: I had to do it quickly, otherwise I'd never do it. I know that nobody's interested in my chest, but I still can't help feeling embarrassed.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Fina [FinaNagisaStart7]*: Ah... alright... Remember, ~nagisa~, it's not any different from any other part of your body. It only seems different because of the taboos and customs that most people have...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_never_shown]*: I know... but... but... I've never shown anyone before!

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Fina [FinaNagisaContinue7]*: I understand... Doing something for the very first time can be really difficult. But I believe in you, and if you're able to do this, I think it will make you even stronger than you are now...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_a_braver_person]*: I'll do it! I'll become a braver person!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Fina [FinaNagisaEnd7]*: Oh, I'm so proud of you, ~nagisa~... You made it all the way! Do you feel any better now...?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_proud_of_self]*: I'm so proud of myself for doing that! But, um, I don't really feel any less embarrassed about it...

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED PANTIES:
Fina [FinaNagisaParents]*: ~Nagisa~... you said not even your parents have seen you this way? Or did you mean, anyone outside your family...?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_bathing]*: I used to take baths with my mom when I was a little girl of course, but that was a long time ago. When we had a bath with Fuu-chan, I wore my school swimsuit...

---

FINA MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart1]*: Well, this won't be very arousing, so... does anyone want to tell me about themselves? Some of you attend school, correct? I've never been to a formal institution of learning, so I'm curious...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_start1]*: I love my school! There are so many fun people, and I learn so much! Do you get homeschooled, Fina? Is your mom a teacher like my mom?

FINA STRIPPING BOOTS (accessory):
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue1]*: Well, I'm... not exactly sure I have a mother, so not really, ~nagisa~... And, I suppose I had all the formal schooling I've had at home, but I've found that I learn better by experience.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_experience]*: What kind of experience? Like an apprenticeship?

FINA STRIPPED BOOTS (accessory):
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd1]*: Not quite... I meant that by exploring the world and seeing it firsthand, I learn much more than I ever did in seclusion. But, I do find the thought of being an apprentice pirate quite amusing...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_exploring]: Wow, exploring the world... I've never even left my town. But that's okay, because I love it very much!


FINA MUST STRIP HEADDRESS:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart2]*: So, where is your hometown, ~nagisa~? Perhaps my crew and I could pay you a visit...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_whole_crew]*: Your crew, Fina? The whole crew? How many people are in the crew? We don't really have any parking spaces...

FINA STRIPPING HEADDRESS (accessory):
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue2]* Oh, don't worry, it's not very many people at present... It's mostly me, Vyse, and Aika these days. We don't have a huge crew anymore, the way we did when we were flying in the Delphinus...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_lunch]*: If it's just three of you, maybe we can have you over for lunch! I can help my mom with the cooking. Are there any foods you don't eat?

FINA STRIPPED HEADDRESS (accessory):
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd2]*: Thank you so much for offering, ~nagisa~... I don't have any special requirements, and I think the same is true of Vyse and Aika. Although, Aika tends to eat quite a lot, just to warn you...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cook_extra]*: Haha, mom and I can cook extra if you need us to.


FINA MUST STRIP SLEEVES:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart3]*: Oh... I'm sorry, everyone, I, um... I'm still a little inexperienced at being the center of attention. I'm not usually the one who's expected to speak up among my crew, so...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_called_on]*: I know what you mean, Fina! It's like being called on by the teacher in class... but the teacher doesn't normally ask you to take something off too...

FINA STRIPPING SLEEVES (minor):
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue3][CupilStrippingChirp]*: Honestly, I think being called on is <i>harder</i> for me than the undressing, ~nagisa~, at least while I'm still removing small items---{Cupil}[Chirp?]{!reset} Oh? Did you want to be a small item, too, Cupil?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_query]*: Cupil?

FINA STRIPPED SLEEVES (minor): Cupil revealed
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd3]*: Oh, yes, this is Cupil... He's decided to come off along with my ~clothing~, apparently. Normally he's a bracelet on my arm, so I guess he already <i>is</i> a small item in that sense... {Cupil}[Chirp?]{!reset}
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_nice_to_meet_cupil]*: Oh, wow! He's so cute! Like a little floating dango! Hello, Cupil! It's nice to meet you. My name is Nagisa Furukawa.

FINA HAND AFTER STRIPPED SLEEVES:
Fina [FinaNagisaCham]*: I think Cupil really likes you, ~nagisa~... Well, either that, or there's a Cham on you somewhere. He can't seem to sit still or be quiet when there's food nearby... {Cupil}[Chirp! Chirp!]{!reset}
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_cupil_friends]*: I think Cupil and I could be good friends.


FINA MUST STRIP DRESS AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA NOT STRIPPED BRA:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart4Stranger]*: Ah... well... This is it, I guess. I knew this was coming, but... it's different when it's actually happening...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_dress_sympathy]*: I don't think my heart is ready! Give me a little more time to prepare myself.

FINA STRIPPING DRESS (revealing chest) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA NOT STRIPPED BRA:
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue4Sympathy]*: Alright... I'll do it slowly, but I don't want to make anyone wait too long. Are you ready...?
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_do_it]*: D-Do it!

FINA STRIPPED DRESS (revealed chest) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA NOT STRIPPED BRA:
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd4Sympathy]*: There... Ah, that feels so much better, actually. Now that it's all over, it's... quite invigorating, I think...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_strength]*: Even despite your situation, you're still managing to draw strength from it. You're amazing, Fina!


FINA MUST STRIP DRESS AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA TOPLESS:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart4Stranger]*: Ah... well... This is it, I guess. I knew it was coming, and I'm not even the first, but... it's different when it's actually happening to me...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_dress_empathy]*: I felt exactly the same. I don't know if my heart was ready, but I don't think I could have ever prepared.

FINA STRIPPING DRESS (revealing chest) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA TOPLESS:
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue4Empathy]*: Yes, I think... sometimes your heart will never really be ready. You just have to... press on anyway, and trust that you'll make it to the other side...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_you_can_make_it]*: I believe in you! You can make it!

FINA STRIPPED DRESS (revealed chest) AND FINA'S FIRST TIME AND NAGISA TOPLESS:
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd4Empathy]*: Thank you so much, ~nagisa~... It's a great relief to have that over with. I don't think this will be so bad after all...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_joining_in]*: This is still the most embarrassing thing I've done in my entire life... but I feel a little bit safer with you joining in too, Fina.


FINA MUST STRIP DRESS AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart4Friend]*: Oh, my... Alright, we're at this point. It's not my first time, but even so... I'm not sure I'll ever feel prepared to do this...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_never_gets_easier]*: You mean... it never gets easier?

FINA STRIPPING DRESS (revealing chest) AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue4Friend]*: I wouldn't say it doesn't get easier, ~nagisa~... I think I'm getting used to it, little by little. But, it's never stopped feeling like... something I shouldn't be doing... and I sort of like that feeling, to be honest...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_naughty_thoughts]*: Fina! I had no idea you had such naughty thoughts... Does... does exposing yourself really make you feel good?

FINA STRIPPED DRESS (revealed chest) AND FINA'S PLAYED BEFORE:
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd4Friend]*: The Silvite Elders told me never to expose my body to others, so I know how you feel... But, the Elders meant for me to spend my whole life alone in the Shrine. I won't deny myself happiness for their... flawed precepts.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_bad_girls]*: <i>(I shouldn't judge her. Maybe I'm a bad girl too. I kind of liked it when ~player~ was looking at me before...)</i>


FINA MUST STRIP DRESS AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart4Close]*: I see... This is it, then. No matter how many times I do this, I never quite feel prepared for it... I think that rush of excitement is what keeps me coming back to this game...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_exciting_game]*: This game is kind of exciting, isn't it? But I don't know if it's in a good way or a bad way.

FINA STRIPPING DRESS (revealing chest) AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue4Close]*: That probably depends on the person, ~nagisa~. For me, though... it's definitely in a good way. It has the thrill of being... in danger, and vulnerable to others... but without the dire consequences...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_scary_movie]*: It's kind of like a scary movie. I'm not good with scary movies either, but I'm okay if I have someone to hold on to.

FINA STRIPPED DRESS (revealed chest) AND FINA CLOSE TO PLAYER:
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd4Close]*: Ah... oh my... That's an interesting thought. I wonder if holding onto someone would be... helpful... in this situation... -- To clarify, horny pose here (probably "intrigued").
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_personal_space]*: We have to respect everyone's personal space. If we want someone to hold us, we have to ask ~player.ifMale(his|her)~ permission first.


FINA MUST STRIP LEGGINGS:
Fina [NagisaFinaStart5]*: Oh, finally. Thank the Moons... ah... Maybe it's a bit odd to be relieved, but... honestly, I think I'll be more comfortable with these off at this point...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_tight_tights]*: Are they too tight? I have a pair that are too tight, but they fit me better in middle school.

FINA STRIPPING LEGGINGS (revealing crotch):
Fina [NagisaFinaContinue5]*: Um... no, they're not too tight, ~nagisa~. They're very comfortable and flexible, but... well, they've gotten a bit damp, so...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_lewd_thoughts]*: <i>(Has Fina been thinking about lewd things this whole time we were talking? Wait, about me?! No! Definitely not. She probably just likes ~player~. ~player.ifMale(He's really handsome|She's really beautiful)~, after all.)</i>

FINA STRIPPED LEGGINGS (revealed crotch):
Fina [NagisaFinaEnd5]*: Um... I'm so sorry, that was probably more than you wanted to know... I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable. This game is... well, I might be getting a bit carried away...
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_secrets_shared]*: Um, thank you for being courageous enough to share your secrets with us, Fina.

FINA HAND AFTER STRIPPED LEGGINGS IF NAGISA NOT OUT:
Fina [NagisaFinaWet]*: <i>(Moons above, I really am wet... I don't know how much more of this I can take. I couldn't bear to just give up and throw the game, but... Come on, ~player~, just one more loss!)</i> -- Note to self: I'll need to make an alt case for this in case the player's already out of the game. Also, this line can probably play regardless of whether Nagisa is out.
Nagisa [nagisa_fina_also_wet]*: <i>(A-Am I getting a bit wet down there too?! Ah! Oh no... I hope nobody can tell just by looking at me!)</i>
