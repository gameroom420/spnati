Ideas from Targeting Pigeons:
- Robin is pretty insightful, so I don't think she would get a bad read on Nagisa. Something to play with could be Nagisa's perception of women who exude authority and have femdom energy. I think Robin would like Nagisa because I wrote her as having a thing for girls who are more timid, but I never like to jump straight into sexual stuff because I feel like it makes my characters seem predatory. I prefer it when characters get to know each other personally first.
- Nagisa is less worldly-wise than Nico, more na√Øve.
- Intelectual curiosity is most of what motivates how Robin starts conversation: asking about school (there's not a lot of options there)
- Common ground with Nagisa in that they're both introverts, but Nagisa is shy while Robin is the more loner type of introvert. But also because Robin is not an emotional person, it's tough having her bring up stuff like that.

Not recommended targeting topics for Robin:
-"What's your ability?" She already explains this early in the game, so you can react to that instead (marker: flower_ability). More specific questions about her ability, like whether she can do this or that are better, but she also has received a lot of targets like that already.
-"What's a Devil Fruit?" She also explains this right after showing her ability (marker: devil_fruits). But other questions about Devil Fruits are fine.
-"What do you do?" I'd prefer it if characters skipped this and just talked to her as if they already knew that she's a pirate and an archaeologist to avoid wasting a case.
-"You're tall". It's fine if the character has something more to say about her being tall, but don't just make it an observation. That won't get much of a response out of her.

Not recommended targeting topic for Nagisa:
- "Be brave. You can do it!" - always true and relevant, but Arndress has written SO many variations on this. It will probably will happen as filler somewhere, especially when Nagisa's focus is on her own nudity, but it's nice to have a unique element for these kinds of lines to soak in.


If Nagisa to left and Robin to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_robin_nr_n1]: Sorry! They never taught us the rules of poker in high school, so I might make a few mistakes here and there.
Robin [nagisa0]: Such a sweet and friendly girl... If I had met you when I was in school, I might've actually made more than one friend before I turned 28.
   OR [nagisa0]: You have such a calm and friendly presence, Nagisa. I'm sure even my younger self could've befriended you. Then I would've had at least two friends, heeheeh...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_robin_nr_n2]: I'm surprised that even a pretty lady like you had trouble making friends. I'm the same. I feel like I could stand on the path to school forever, and maybe only one person would want to meet me.

ROBIN MUST STRIP SUNGLASSES:
Nagisa [nagisa_robin_nr_r1]: Excuse me, ma'am, but I think it's you. It's nice that you could have the ~background.time~ off work to play with us.
Robin [resp_nagisa0]: Heheh, there's no need to address me so formally, Nagisa. And just so you know, I'm a pirate. It's not as if I have a regular work schedule.
   OR [resp_nagisa0]: Please, call me Robin. I'd like to think that I'm still too young to be a "ma'am". Besides, I'm a pirate. Not the most traditional or respectful occupation.

ROBIN STRIPPING SUNGLASSES:
Nagisa [nagisa_robin_nr_r2]: Robin is a pretty name, like the bird. I thought I heard someone say you were an archaeologist, Robin. Unless... Wait, you wouldn't steal <i>from</i> archaeologists, would you? I don't even know if archaeologists travel by ship.
