NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Miko [NagisaShoes1]: Lady Nagisa, would you mind terribly if I studied you? It’s just, you present such a <i>fascinating</i> specimen. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n01]: M-Me?! Um, you can study me if you want, but I'm not that fascinating really.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES:
Miko [NagisaShoes2]: A dark aura surrounds you, Lady Nagisa. Yet, at the center, a divine blessing shines. It rivals even the fortune of the Shine Maiden of Paradise. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n02]: Can you really see my aura, Miko? What does it mean to have a dark aura? I... I don't like the sound of that.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES:
Miko [NagisaShoes3]: Yet, I fear that neither you, nor the one who bestowed the blessing, understands its true nature or capabilities, Lady Nagisa. Nothing is more volatile than unknown divinity. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n03]: If you find out what it means, please tell me. I don't really know much about blessings and that kind of thing.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Miko [NagisaSock1]: I am correct in presuming that your blessing was bestowed almost by accident, Lady Nagisa. Still, for an otherwise normal human to call down the power of the gods— one cannot take that lightly. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n04]: I'm not sure, Miko. I don't remember getting any blessings. My family's not very religious or anything.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS:
Miko [NagisaSock2]: I honestly fear I’ve never loved my own progeny so. And, thanks to my immortality, most of my heirs have long passed. All that remains is the youkai of the masks I once crafted, Hata no Kokoro. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n05]: Oh, I'm so sorry if I reminded you of something sad. They say the greatest tragedy is when a parent outlives her child.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS:
Miko [NagisaSock3]: Your blessing is the real deal, Lady Nagisa. Though darkness may yet swirl about you, never shall it touch you. And without control of it, your neck may as well be underneath a sword. -- please set to play only when Nagisa is to the right
Nagisa [nagisa_miko_mn_n06]: That sounds more like a curse. What if... what if I'm just making everyone I talk to sadder just by me being around. Maybe I should just be considerate and leave everyone else alone...


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Miko [NagisaJacket1]: Ah, forgive me,Lady Nagisa. I’ve prattled on about your blessing this long without properly explaining it, haven’t I?
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET:
Miko [NagisaJacket2]: I honestly can’t claim to know the details, Lady Nagisa, but your sire made a wish for you to live despite your dark fate. A wish which was granted by a god.
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET:
Miko [NagisaJacket3]: Without proper knowledge of the divine, Lady Nagisa, you are likely to inadvertently bequeath your blessing to another you love deeply. And then, the darkness shall have no impediment.
Nagisa []*: ??


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Miko [NagisaShirt1]: Lady Nagisa. There is someone in your life, is there not, who can see the barren land between the divine and the dark. He who can see the Illusionary World.
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT:
Miko [NagisaShirt2]: The land of illusion, Gensokyo, is from where I derive. If <i>he</i> can see such a land, perhaps he has the slimmest chance to salvage your fate. Or <i>she</i>, I’m not really sure but I en\courage non-hetero\norma\tive relation\ships.
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT:
Miko [NagisaShirt3]: Regardless, Lady Nagisa, I urge you to seek the council of a spiritual advisor. I can recommend a lazy, if hypercompetent, shrine maiden. Otherwise, I fear we shall not meet again.
Nagisa []*: ??


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Miko [NagisaSkirt1]: Oh! Forgive me, Lady Nagisa, surely you must be confused as to how I know all about you. To put it simply, I am the legendary Prince Shoutoku. A saint. And my ability is that of preternatural hearing.
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT:
Miko [NagisaSkirt2]: After you uttered a single sentence, Lady Nagisa, I knew everything about you— your past, your present, and your future. And from the beginning, I knew exactly how our conversation would unfold.
Nagisa []*: ??

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT:
Miko [NagisaSkirt3]: Truthfully, I haven’t paid attention to what you’ve been saying or <i>when</i> you’ve been saying it! For me, Lady Nagisa, such things are irrelevant. I know you understand.
