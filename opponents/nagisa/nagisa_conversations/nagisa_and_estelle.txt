Notes from Cipher: Estelle has a ridiculous number of alternate outfits. If we want the conversation to make sense in all those outfits, it's probably best not to comment too much on clothing. I guess that's true in general, but it's -especially- true for Estelle. 
Both Nagisa and Estelle were raised to be "proper". with a lot of constraints on the way they lived their lives (or that's my impression based on Fina's targets with Nagisa). Something that ties into those similarities might prompt a conversation.
However, a difference between Estelle and Nagisa is that Nagisa's technology is from approximately 2004.


If Nagisa to left and Estelle to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n1]: Me? Oh, yeah. That makes sense. Does anyone know how long this game normally goes for? If I'm not home by a reasonable time to~background.time~, my mom and dad might start getting worried about me.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReply1]*: Oh, is that so, ~nagisa~? We'd better be careful, then---I wouldn't want you to miss your curfew! If we're taking too much time, it should be fine if you just leave early.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n2]: It wouldn't be fair to everyone else if I left early. If it starts getting late, I'll see if I can find a payphone to let them know not to worry.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyContinue1]*: A payphone? Those work like blastia that allow you to communicate over long distances, right? I've read about them, but I've never seen one before. Could I come with you to see the payphone?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n3]*: I'm not really sure what a "ballista" is, but sure, we can go together! And I could walk you home if you're staying nearby. -- "ballista" error intentional
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd1=blastia]*: <i>"Blastia use the primeval power of aer that fills the world to provide us with fire, water, and light. They provide us with everything that has made the empire prosper."</i> ...And thank you, but I don't live nearby.
     OR [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd1=payphones]*: How wonderful! I'm so excited to visit one of your world's bustling metropolises, with majestic payphones dotting the streets as far as the eye can see... And that's all right, I don't live around here.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n4]: It's me again. That's okay. Should I ask permission to take my socks off? It's probably expected, but I don't want to be impolite.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReply2]*: I'm sure it's fine, ~nagisa~. It's certainly what <i>I'd</i> expect, and I don't think anyone in particular is in charge of the game, so I don't know who you'd ask. If anyone objects, I'll take full responsibility.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n5]: I couldn't let you do take responsibility for something I did, Estelle! If I'm the one who's doing something wrong, then I accept any punishment decided for me.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyContinue2]*: But if I tell you it's acceptable to remove your socks and I'm wrong, the whole thing is <i>my</i> fault for giving you incorrect information. So I think it makes more sense that <i>I'd</i> receive the punishment.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n6]*: Let's agree that we should <i>both</i> be punished then. That way we can share responsibility. But who is going to punish us?
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd2]*: I suppose that's an acceptable compromise. Perhaps ~player~ should be in charge of punishing us, since ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ invited us here? Ah, but you've removed them already, and no one's objected. Never mind, then.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n7]: This is my first ever time playing an adult game like this. Thanks for putting up with me! I'm doing my best.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReply3]*: Think nothing of it, ~nagisa~. I haven't ever done anything like this, either---but if we're determined enough, and don't let these lewd circumstances affect us, I'm certain we'll be able to get through it!

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n8]: I have to admit, I didn't know what to expect. It's still hard to imagine anyone having <i>those</i> kinds of thoughts about someone like me.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyContinue3]*: Were you kept indoors a lot growing up? Because I was, and I understand exactly what you mean. I'm not completely accustomed to the idea of others thinking about me like that, either.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n9]*: Yeah... I have to stay indoors a lot, especially over winter, because I get sick sometimes. I don't get to meet too many people outside of school.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd3]*: I'm sorry to hear that... Then we must be here for similar reasons. We're not satisfied with being sheltered from the world---and so we've come here to explore ourselves, and take matters into our own hands!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n10]: Um, may I have everyone's attention? I... I have to take my ~clothing~ off... I don't want you to think I'm being improper, but it's the rules. And... and my chest isn't very impressive, but please don't be too disappointed.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReply4]*: I'd never accuse you of impropriety for following the rules, ~nagisa~. Though it certainly is a strange idea, isn't it? Normally, laws exist to <i>prevent</i> such indecent behavior... This game turns everything on its head!

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n11]: I didn't even think of that! Are we breaking the law? Am I a criminal now?!
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyContinue4]*: Well, I certainly don't think so. Yuri didn't seem concerned about this place's legality when he described it to me. But then again, he's never that worried about---oh my, I hope this <i>is</i> legal!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n12]*: What if this makes the newspaper?! "Famous princess and local girl jailed"?! I don't want my photo on the front page!
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd4]*: It's all right, ~nagisa~---if it comes to that, I promise I'll figure it out. The worst they'll do to <i>me</i> is take me back to the castle, so all I need to do is convince them it was my fault, and they'll let you go.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n13]: Ah. Um, please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to lose or anything. Not in front of such important company...
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReply5]*: I didn't think you were, ~nagisa~, but I'm glad to hear it. I suppose some commoners might be so afraid to win against a noble like me that they'd throw the game, but I'd much rather you gave it your all! -- Hopefully that wording is sufficiently flexible that it'll make sense even if Estelle's already lost, since Nagisa could still lose alongside Estelle.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n14]: I suppose where you're from, Estelle, ladies would even take their skirts off and put them in front of you so your feet don't have to touch the dirty ~background.surface~. At least that's what I remember from a movie once... So, um, you can stand on mine if you want to.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyContinue5]*: That's very kind of you, but I couldn't agree to that. Stepping on a commoner's possessions just to preserve your own elegance... That's definitely not the type of noble I'd like to be.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_estelle_ne_n15]*: That's a relief. My mom would probably start to wonder if I came home with footprints on my clothes.
Estelle [NagisaEstelleReplyEnd5]*:

ESTELLE MUST STRIP GLOVES:
Nagisa []*: Excuse me, Estelle, but I think you might have lost this one. It's nice to meet you, by the way. Sorry if I didn't say that before. My name's Nagisa. Oh, you already know that. Anyway, sorry!
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply1]*: It's nice to meet you too, ~nagisa~, but you don't need to apologize! Are you intimidated because I'm royalty? I'd really like us to be friends, so it's fine if you just relax and treat me like you would anyone.

ESTELLE STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa []*: You're royalty? Oh, wow. I was daydreaming earlier, so I'm sorry if you were announced. I didn't even wear my nice dress! I've never been friends with a princess before. Do you live in a castle? Are you married to a prince? No, of course not. Unless it was an arranged marriage? That's personal, so I shouldn't ask about that. Do you have a tiara? What country are you from? Is your dad the king? Sorry for asking so many questions... -- This rambling line isn't visible after the word "arranged" if Nagisa has her waitress headpiece on. If not, it can be read until "personal."
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue1]*: Well, let me see... I used to live in a castle. but nowadays I spend most of my time traveling. I'm not married to anyone, and.... ah... Sorry, I don't think I heard everything you were trying to ask.

ESTELLE STRIPPED GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa []*: Um, may I ask what you prefer to be called? Is it "your highness" or "your worship"? I always get those mixed up.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd1]*: Oh, please, just call me Estelle! It's not appropriate to call a friend either of those things... Why don't you share a high five with me? Perhaps that'll help you think of me in a more companionable way.

ESTELLE HAND AFTER STRIPPED GLOVES
Nagisa []*: Are you sure your bodyguards won't mind if we high five? I don't want to get arrested.
Estelle []*: ~Nagisa~, the Knights wouldn't arrest you for that even if they somehow found us here. And even if they <i>did</i> arrest you for some reason, I'd see to it that they let you go, so please don't worry!


--Divided these up by outfit as well as the ones later on. I've copied over the lines already written, but feel free to change your lines for any of them, and I can write different responses to them.

ESTELLE MUST STRIP OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Nagisa []*: So... I was wondering. Your highness--- ah, I mean <i>Estelle</i>. Are you sure it's okay to be playing a game like this with a commoner like me?
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply2=default]*: I think so, ~nagisa~. Some among the nobility might disagree, but it's exactly that sort of arrogance that's been corrupting the Empire, so I don't really care whether they do or not.

ESTELLE STRIPPING OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT (minor):
Nagisa []*: I wouldn't want you to lose the respect of your subjects just because you made some new friends. You shouldn't have to give up the claim to the throne over something like that.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue2=default]*: Oh, I've spent plenty of time traveling with commoners already, and I have no claim to the throne anymore, either. So---oof, sorry. I'll just be a moment...

ESTELLE STRIPPED OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Nagisa []*: Oh no. That doesn't seem fair. I think you really look the part for a queen. Um, when you have all of your dress on and your hair was like it was a minute ago, I mean.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=default]*: Oh, thank you for saying so! But I'd rather not deal with the responsibility of becoming queen, anyway. Ioder will do a much better job of uniting the world than I---wait, what's wrong with my hair?


ESTELLE MUST STRIP VEST, VDAY OUTFIT:
Nagisa []*: Estelle, did someone make you take off your skirt before I got here? Maybe you should skip this turn. I don't think it would be fair if we made a princess start in her underwear.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply2=vday]*: Huh? W-Well, no, this is just a, er... I'm still wearing a skirt, it's just quite... This is a special outfit, I suppose. It's designed to... attract attention.

ESTELLE STRIPPING VEST, VDAY OUTFIT (minor):
Nagisa []*: Oh, I see... Wait, Estelle! You're not trapped in some prince's harem, are you?! I'm sure we could rescue you if we all worked together.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue2=vday]*: No, no! I just have this outfit because Karol wanted---er, because Yuri said---Well, it's not important why I have it, but I'm using it now to seduce ~player~. Ah, how does this even come off again?

ESTELLE STRIPPED VEST, VDAY OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Nagisa []*: Ohhhhhh... You just mean you're going to flirt with ~player~, right? You're not going to start kissing or anything, right?
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=vday]*: Yes, exactly. I was hoping to convince ~player.ifMale(him|her)~ to have dinner with me, or go for a walk---even hold hands if we were feeling <i>really</i> adventurous. Oh, but I should fix my hair before we do that.


ESTELLE MUST STRIP HAT, CHRISTMAS OUTFIT:
Nagisa []*: I like your outfit, Estelle. It's so... seasonal. My birthday is on December 24, so Christmas is a special time of year for me too.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply2=christmas]*: Thank you so much, ~nagisa~! We don't exactly have Christmas in Terca Lumireis, but it sounds wonderful, and I've read so much about it that I'm confident I can accurately conform to its traditions.

ESTELLE STRIPPING HAT, CHRISTMAS OUTFIT (minor):
Nagisa []*: Christmas is meant to be a romantic time of year, so a lot of people like to go on dates. But it can get pretty cold too! -- Comment: I'm deliberately avoiding mentioning if it's December right now because the player might be using Estelle's costume at a different time of year.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue2=christmas]*: Yes, but the cold only encourages you to sit by the fire indoors, holding hands and roasting chestnuts... It's enough to make anyone's heart tingle with joy. Oh, my hair's tingling, too...

ESTELLE STRIPPED HAT, CHRISTMAS OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Nagisa []*: Oh, Estelle, your hair is all messed up! That happens to me all the time too, especially at this time of year. No matter how hard I try, it will never all sit flat.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=christmas]*: Ah, I should have been more careful... I think I have it easier than you, since my hair isn't hard to manage as long as I brush it frequently. Hmmm, I did remember to bring a hairbrush with me, didn't I? 


ESTELLE MUST STRIP HAT, SUMMER OUTFIT:
Nagisa []*: You're so brave to be wearing a bikini to a game like this, Estelle. Sheer materials are so pretty... but they're hard to wear to the beach when they're see-through...
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply2=summer]*: Huh? Wait... is my shirt actually that transparent? With the way it bunches up and the patterning, I didn't think you'd be able to see right through it like that...

ESTELLE STRIPPING HAT, SUMMER OUTFIT (minor):
Nagisa []*: Well it's not <i>completely</i> transparent, but it kind of makes me feel like I have x-ray vision. It looks good on you because you have a really nice figure... unless we weren't supposed to know that yet.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue2=summer]*: ??

ESTELLE STRIPPED HAT, SUMMER OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Nagisa []*: ??
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=summer]*: ??


--Note to self for Cipher: Rita should probably react to these lines if she's present.
---Reply from Arndress: I've added a section for Rita below. I'm planning to do something similar for Panty to chime in on whatever's Stocking's saying, but without trying to steer a conversation.
ESTELLE MUST STRIP WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT: 
Nagisa []*: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get a witch-princess mad with me! Please don't turn us into frogs... If I have to be turned into something, please turn me into a dango.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReply2=witch]*: Huh? You didn't anger me, ~nagisa~, I just lost. And I'm not planning to use my magic on anything other than my own clothing. Rita didn't teach me any spells to use on other players.
Rita [RitaEstelleNagisaReplyReact2=witch]:* Turning people into animals is overrated anyway. Do you have any idea how much aer that would take? Or how difficult the calculations would be? Living things are complicated, you know.

ESTELLE STRIPPING WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT (minor):
Nagisa []*: So she just taught you how to turn your clothes into frogs? That doesn't seem like a very good idea for when you want to get dressed later, but I suppose you could cover yourself strategically with them...
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyContinue2=witch]*: No, not turn them into frogs. I don't have any idea what to feed a frog, so I don't know what I'd do with the poor things. It just makes them vanish, like this!
Rita [RitaEstelleNagisaReplyContinueReact2=witch]:* Come on, ~nagisa~, <i>clothes</i> to frogs isn't any better. That's almost <i>worse</i>, since they're not alive in the first place! Why are amateurs always so obsessed with the whole frog thi---uh, ~estelle~, your form's a bit off...

ESTELLE STRIPPED WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Nagisa []*: Whoa... real magic. That's amazing, Estelle. You could've won the whole game just by pointing your wand at people. You shouldn't, of course. That would be cheating.
Estelle [EstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=witch]*: It's more complicated than that, anyway, ~nagisa~... I have to learn a new variation of the spell for each item. Rita said it's easy to modify it on the fly, but the calculations she uses for that are so difficult...
OR (if Rita is present)
Estelle [EstelleNagisaRitaReplyEnd2=witch]*: I'd have to learn a new variation of the spell to do something like that anyway, ~nagisa~. I know you told me how to recalculate the formula for other items, ~rita~, but, er... it's pretty difficult...
Rita [RitaEstelleNagisaReplyEnd2=witch]:* Yeah, you should really get this special case down before you try to generalize anything. Otherwise you'll do what you did yesterday and just vanish all of <i>your</i> clothes or something. That'd be... uh... wow. Th-That'd be bad.

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Estelle to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart1]*: ~Nagisa~, I realize this is probably overwhelming for you, but I'm here to support you however I can. If you feel uncomfortable, or if you need anything at any time, please let me know!
Nagisa []*: That's so nice of you, Estelle. I'm managing for now, but I hope we'll both be able to support each other if we need it.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue1]*: That sounds wonderful. I'm glad so many women seem to frequent this place---I was afraid it'd be mostly men, which would have been pretty intimidating. It's much more comfortable with girls my age around.
Nagisa []*: Yeah, I feel the same way. If anything, I was more intimidated by many beautiful ladies I saw when I got here, hehe! I'm eighteen. How old are you, Estelle?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd1]*: I'm twenty-one myself. And don't worry about that, ~nagisa~---you're quite a beautiful woman in your own right, so you have no reason to be intimidated!
-- Canonically, Estelle is 18. However, since Rita is also in the game and must be at least 18, Estelle now comes from an AU where everyone is three years older than in canon but nothing else is changed. (Too much changes at the end of the game for it to be feasible to have them come from after it's over.)
Nagisa []*: I know that last part's not true, but thank you for saying so. You're a nice person, Estelle.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart2]*: So, ~nagisa~, tell me about the school you go to! I've only had private tutors before, but it must be so much easier to make friends at a proper school! Do you have lots of friends?
Nagisa []*: I don't really know many people at school. All of my friends graduated last year, but I had to repeat. So I only know a few people.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue2]*: Oh... I'm sorry to hear that. I suppose that must be the downside of a school where anyone can enter or leave as they wish. Do your teachers stay the same, at least?
Nagisa []*: My teachers are all different this year. I loved taking art with Miss Ibuki, but she left the school a few years ago.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd2]*: Well, what sorts of things did you do in class with her? Do you have any of your old artwork to remember her by? Mementos like that really help me when I'm missing someone.
Nagisa []*: Ms. Ibuki was a lovely painter, but she also liked wood carving. I don't have any art from that class anymore, but I have lots of nice memories.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart3]*: ~Nagisa~, you must read plenty of books at your school, mustn't you? Tell me, which books do they have you reading? Are there any you're particularly fond of, or favorite subjects to read about?
Nagisa []*: In class we've been reading about Urashima Taro. It's a folk tale about a fisherman who saves a turtle. It turns out that the turtle is a princess!

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue3]*: That sounds wonderful! And what happens next? I hope the fisherman and the turtle princess get married and live happily ever after! Ah, but I suppose you may not have finished it yet...
Nagisa []*: I don't think humans are allowed to marry turtle royalty, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the man goes home from the turtle kingdom, but he's shocked to learn that more than 100 years has passed!

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd3]*: Oh, no! I can only imagine how much must have changed after 100 years... But I suppose it can't be helped, since he couldn't just leave the turtle princess to her fate. What a predicament!
Nagisa []*: I know it's just a story, but it makes me a little sad. Maybe that's because I felt so alone when all my friends graduated without me.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart4]*: So, ~nagisa~... I know you don't have many friends right now at your school, but... what about <i>special</i> friends? Is there anyone you like right now? If you tell me, I promise I'll keep it a secret!
Nagisa []*: Ah! Um. M-Maybe. But he has lots of beautiful girls chasing him now, so I don't stand a chance. I just like it when he talks to me.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue4]*: Well, who knows? You might be underestimating your own charms, and there's no sense in giving up before the battle's fought. You're at least planning to get to know him better, right? There's no harm in that!
Nagisa []*: By "get to know him better", you don't mean I should take my ~clothing~ off for you, do you? That's... He might not ever speak to me again!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd4]*: Wh-What?! No, of course not! I'd never suggest something so indecent... I only meant you should have tea with him, or go for a walk in the park together, or something like that!
Nagisa []*: Oh, sorry for misunderstanding... Sometimes we walk to school together, and we can have tea with Miyazawa in the reference room. I don't think we'll ever go out or anything.


-- Estelle is too deep in the closet to think of anything outside a "man". But it might be interesting to branch this somehow based on ~player~'s gender, as I know you do sometimes to cater to female players. It'd probably need to be Nagisa who initiates it though, as Estelle is too clueless about this subject.

NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT, MALE PLAYER:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart5=male]*: What do you look for in a man, ~nagisa~? I'd like to marry someone strong and brave, who seeks just solutions even in a mire of darkness and chaos---like the Amber Knight, from <i>Tale of the Jade Planet</i>.
Nagisa []*: I'd like someone who was kind and friendly and dependable... but it wouldn't hurt if he was strong and handsome too, would it? Someone who could sweep me off my feet and even... even kiss me...

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT, MALE PLAYER (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue5=male]*: Oh, that sounds wonderful! Have you never kissed anyone, ~nagisa~? Neither have I, but I'd really like to someday. I just need to meet the right person.
Nagisa []*: I'm pretty sure you're supposed to let a boy kiss you before you show him your underwear... so I've got it all backwards to~background.time~. My heart couldn't take doing both, I don't think.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT, MALE PLAYER (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd5=male]*: You're right! That's quite a breach of etiquette. Yuri's commoner sensibilities must be rubbing off on me... But it shouldn't be a problem for you since you're not a noble, right?
Nagisa []*: 


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT, FEMALE PLAYER:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart5=female]*: So, tell me about what you look for in a man, ~nagisa~! Even if it doesn't work out between you and that boy in the end, I'm sure the world is full of many wonderful people who would be delighted to marry you.
Nagisa []*: I don't think anybody would be interested in marrying someone like me. If I could choose anyone, the kind of person I like is kind and friendly and dependable and would get along with my mom and dad. If there was someone like that, I wouldn't mind who it was. -- Comment: Battling with the fact that Nagisa is straight, so she's unlikely to have a female partner as a first choice, so I tried to leave it open here.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT, FEMALE PLAYER (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaContinue5=female]*: But why would you say no one would want to marry you, ~nagisa~? You're so kind and sweet, after all, and quite thoughtful as well. If I were a man, I'm sure I'd at least consider marrying you. -- Maybe some innocent, accidentally-gay comments from Estelle will help?
Nagisa []*: That's nice of you to say, Estelle. Wouldn't it be so much easier if girls could marry each other?

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT, FEMALE PLAYER (major):
Estelle [EstelleNagisaEnd5=female]*: Ooh, that actually sounds wonderful! Instead of worrying about lines of succession and producing heirs and everything, we could just have fun together. It'd be like a sleepover every night!
Nagisa []*: Hehe, that would be the best! It's a little easier for me to make friends with girls, and it sounds like so much less pressure.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Estelle [EstelleNagisaStart6]*: Isn't this exciting, ~nagisa~? I'm really looking forward to seeing your breasts, since I can already tell they'll be lovely. Oh, but perhaps I shouldn't say things like that.
Nagisa []*: Ah! Y-You are, Estelle?! Um, I'm sure nobody's ever wanted to see them before, so you're probably just saying that to make me feel better. They're not all that big or special, so I hope everyone isn't too disappointed.

Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart1]*: Then I'm the one who lost... Well, don't worry---I'm fully prepared for this. I planned out my entire stripping order in advance before the game started!
Nagisa []*: Wow. You've put a lot of thought into this. I didn't really come with any strategy at all. I'll be wishing luck to both of us, so maybe you won't end up going the whole way.

ESTELLE STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue1]*: Well... to be honest, ~nagisa~, I didn't form that strategy until I got here. I decided to come without thinking things through... So now, I have to think and plan especially hard to make up for it.
Nagisa []*: That makes sense. Sometimes it's easier to be brave if you don't think about what could go wrong. But, um, did you prepare yourself for what can happen at the <i>end</i> of the game. The, um, y'know... The hardest part.

ESTELLE STRIPPED GLOVES AND DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FORFEIT (accessory):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd1Unknown]*: The hardest part? Is it going to be that bad? I'm aware that there's some sort of big forfeit at the end of the game, but I felt pretty confident I could handle whatever it turned out to be...
Nagisa []*: It's... it's the rude kind... -- I liked your idea and it was too funny not to do. Let's clarify it in an immediately-subsequent hand line like you suggested below.
-- Estelle doesn't remember past games, so every game is her first time, but she has a marker for whether she's found out or not during a game.

ESTELLE STRIPPED GLOVES AND KNOWS ABOUT THE FORFEIT (accessory):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd1Known]*: I... I can handle it, ~nagisa~. I don't know if I could truly be prepared to do something so extreme, but I'm not backing out now that I've come this far!
Nagisa []*: I wish I was as confident as you! If I have to do it, I'll think of you for inspiration. -- meant non-sexually but could be taken otherwise
    OR []*: I believe in you, Estelle! I'll be giving all the support I can if it comes to that. -- tried to write an alternative line for the rare case that Nagisa is out and Estelle is just starting, which I hope works okay enough with Estelle's existing response.

ESTELLE HAND AFTER STRIPPED GLOVES AND DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FORFEIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleRudeForfeit]*: Oh, my... We have to be <i>rude</i> to each other if we lose? I assumed the forfeit would just be some lewd dare... Ah, I don't know if I can go through with this anymore!
Nagisa []*: Oh, no! We don't have to be rude to each other. We have to... um... we have to touch ourselves in front of everyone.

ESTELLE HAND AFTER STRIPPED GLOVES AND KNOWS ABOUT THE FORFEIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleInspiration]*: That's so sweet of you, ~nagisa~! I'd be honored if you thought of me. Perhaps I'll think of you during mine as well, if it comes to that. I'm sure it will be much easier that way for us both. -- Estelle also being 100% innocent here XD
Nagisa []*: Ah, um, I didn't mean... um... T-Thank you. But it's okay if you don't think about me <i>too</i> much.


--Divided these into separate versions for the various outfits. I'm going to try and write separate intros for each of the outfits as well. That'll probably be easier than trying to dance around it like I was before, and hopefully I can make the lines more interesting that way.

ESTELLE MUST STRIP OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart2=default]*: Next on the list is my dress! Well, part of it, at least. Oh, but I don't want to take too long undressing, or everyone will be waiting for me... Is it all right if I ask you to be patient?
Nagisa []*: I don't know a lot about royal dresses, but I'm sure each piece takes almost as long to take off as it does to put on. Please be careful and take all the time you need.

ESTELLE STRIPPING OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT (minor):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue2=default]*: Well, I can at least try to speed things up a bit. You're not really supposed to pull it over your head like this, but I'd much rather be respectful of everyone's time and nmm tmg mm lng...
Nagisa []*: I'm sorry, Estelle, but could you repeat that last part? Um, do you want help? Are you stuck?

ESTELLE STRIPPED OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd2=default]*: Huh? Did you say something to me, ~nagisa~? I got stuck in there for a little while, so I couldn't hear... You don't need my help with anything, do you?
Nagisa []*: I was just wondering if a maid normally helps you out of that part of your dress. I could help you out like a maid just for to~background.time~ if you'd like.

ESTELLE HAND AFTER STRIPPED OVERDRESS, DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleMaidService]*: It's really sweet of you to offer that, ~nagisa~! But I don't think that'll be necessary. I got pretty tired of the maids in the castle attending me all the time, so I'd rather do it myself---even if it's harder that way.
Nagisa []*: Okay. But if you change your mind, I'll be at your beck and call, hehe!


ESTELLE MUST STRIP HAT, CHRISTMAS OR SUMMER OUTFIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart2=hat]*: According to the list I've made, it's time to remove my hat! Hehe, this is actually quite fun. They'd never have let me play anything like this back at the castle.
Nagisa []*: Don't they have festivals at the castle? My school is really strict with uniform most of the time, but we can get special permission during the Founders Festival to hold a maid cafe.

ESTELLE STRIPPING HAT, CHRISTMAS OR SUMMER OUTFIT (minor):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue2=hat]*: They did hold festivities there every year, but only nobles and knights could attend, and it was very ceremonial. I wasn't allowed to go to any of the more lively solstice celebrations.
Nagisa []*: That's too bad. But at least you got to dress up today! Or dress down, hehe!

ESTELLE STRIPPED HAT, CHRISTMAS OR SUMMER OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd2=hat]*: I suppose it is like dressing down. I wear such elaborate clothing most of the time, and I always seem to mess up my hair somehow when I'm changing. I'm glad that won't happen with a quaint little outfit like this!
Nagisa []*: Um, about that, Estelle...


ESTELLE MUST STRIP VEST, VDAY OUTFIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart2=vday]*: All right, it's time to move on to the next item on my list! Fortunately, I won't need to decide this on the spot with everyone watching. Big decisions are stressful enough when I'm alone.
Nagisa []*: I think this is a much better idea than having no plan because then other people might make bad suggestions. What do you have planned for us this time, Estelle?

ESTELLE STRIPPING VEST, V-DAY OUTFIT (minor):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue2=vday]*: Well, next I'll... hmmm. I should really have practiced taking this off beforehand. I hardly know how this outfit works, since I'm not usually trying to seduce anyone.
Nagisa []*: Is that why you're here? Ah, um, would you like me to help, Estelle? I promise I won't get seduced or anything.

ESTELLE STRIPPED VEST, VDAY OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd2=vday]*: Well, that's not really the risk I had in mind. Not that I'm saying I'd <i>like</i> to seduce you, but I didn't think... Ah, I probably shouldn't have pulled it over my head like that.
Nagisa []*: That's a beautiful corset, Estelle. Any prince would fall in love with you in a heartbeat! But I don't think he'd want us to see you like this in your underwear...


ESTELLE MUST STRIP WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart2=witch]*: All right, everyone! For the next item on my list, I'm going to do a magic trick! Since I'm a witch today, it makes sense that I'd undress magically as well. Just watch this!
Nagisa []*: Do you really know how to do magic tricks, Estelle? That's so cool. We'll all be your audience, okay?

ESTELLE STRIPPING WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT (minor):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue2=witch]*: Most of the magic I know isn't very witch-like, but I learned new vanishing spells especially for this game. Now, watch closely...!
Nagisa []*: I've never seen real stage magic before! I can't wait to see this trick.

ESTELLE STRIPPED WITCH HAT, WITCH OUTFIT (minor; messy hair):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd2=witch]*: Tada! As you can see, the hat is completely---oh, what happened to my hair? I didn't think it'd do that... Maybe I should have practiced that spell a bit more before I came here.
Nagisa []*: Wow! It's like it completely disappeared! I like your hair gag too. You really know how to cheer us up, Estelle!


ESTELLE MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Estelle [NagisaEstelleStart3]*: Ah, it's me again... Normally, when I set out on an adventure with my friends, I'll ensure my feet are clad properly for travel. But we'll be taking another sort of journey to~background.time~, I suppose.
Nagisa []*: You don't need to wear something on your feet everywhere you go, after all. It's true. Like the bath, for instance.

ESTELLE STRIPPING BOOTS (accessory):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleContinue3]*: Oh, you're right. Normally one doesn't wear anything at all in the bath, or at least that's how it is in the hot springs at Yumanju. I wonder if anyone's tried playing games like this there.
Nagisa []*: I'd like to be able to read a book in the bath, but it's too steamy.

ESTELLE STRIPPED BOOTS (accessory):
Estelle [NagisaEstelleEnd3]*: That does sound like a lovely idea if you could figure out how to do it... But, yes, you'd probably ruin the book if you tried that. If only I had a spell to protect the pages...
Nagisa []*: The people who run the Jumanji hot springs might know if you ask them.
