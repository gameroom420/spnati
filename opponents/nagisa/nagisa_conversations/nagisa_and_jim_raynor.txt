If Nagisa to left and Jim Raynor to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_where_do_i_start]*: Ah! It's my turn! Um, what do I do? Where do I start?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_shoes]: Settle down there, boss. You've got your shoes, right? You can still stay well ahead even after takin' those off. -- Figured this would be a good way to assure her she's still a long ways away from being stripped down. I also think Jim deciding to call her "boss" is cute.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_all_new]*: Oh, right, my shoes. Sorry if I get a little flustered. This is all new to me.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_firsttime]: No worries. It's a first time for me as well... the strippin' part, anyway.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_first_timers]*: Is that so? Let's all have our first times together then, 'kay!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_makeitcount]: Er... well, whatever you say, Boss. Let's make it count!


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_plain_girl]*: Oh, it's me? I hope plain socks from a plain girl are enough. That's all I really have to offer. -- I'll pair this with a happy pose so that it's not TOO depressing and self-depricating!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_plain]: Well, speakin' as a plain fellow myself, I got no objections if anyone else does. -- I imagine she'll probably see an obvious disagreement here, which will likely lead to Jimmy rebuting her calling herself plain too.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_beard]*: You have a beard, Mr. Raynor, and that makes you look distinguished. But I'm not very noticible. That's okay! I'm used to it anyway.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_undersell]: Come on, don't undersell yourself like that, boss. I bet there's plenty of guys back where you're from who have you runnin' in their heads.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_not_noticed]*: D-Do you really think so?! I'm not smart or pretty or funny... so boys don't normally talk to me much...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_striking]: Well, maybe they just don't know how to approach you. Nothin' stops guys in their tracks quite like a striking young woman.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_flushed]*: I'm starting to feel flushed. Does anyone mind if I take my jacket off?
    OR [nagisa_jim_flushed]*: I'm starting to feel flushed. Does anyone mind if I take my apron off?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_natural]: Well, it's a pretty natural choice, ain't it? Don't think anyone minds, especially if you're still a bit nervous about this.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_feeling_judged]*: You don't think anybody would think badly of of us just because of how we chose to play, do you?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_quarrel]: Hey, anyone who tries raisin' a quarrel with you about that is gonna have to deal with me first; and I don't think they want that.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_no_bullies]*: I'll be okay if someone tells me I need to do better. It's true, after all. Nobody here is a bully... at least I don't think so.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_throwdown]: Hope not. Didn't come here to throw down, but I'm willin' to make an exception for anyone who wants to mess with you.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_man_just_met]: Um, I feel kind of weird about taking off anything else in front of a man I just met. Mr Raynor, you're not going to watch, are you?
    OR [nagisa_jim_man_just_met]: Um, I feel kind of weird about taking off anything else in front of ~player.ifMale(guys|a man)~ I just met. Mr Raynor and ~player~, you're not going to watch, are you?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_possibility]: Oh, shoot, hadn't thought of that. I hope you'd at least prepared for the possibility this would happen, right?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_close_your_eyes]*: I know you'll all see me after, but if you'd just close your eyes while I actually undress... that would mean a lot to me.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_giveword]: Alright, boss; you have my word I won't look. And I think it'd be best if you gave your word too, ~player~.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_selfish]*: Okay, I'm finished. You can look now. Sorry for making such a selfish request. Next time I'll try to be a little braver.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_comfy]: It's all good - if there's anything we can do to help you get more comfy with it, just say the word.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_seen_it_before]*: This is all totally normal to everyone else, right? Right? I shouldn't be nervous at all because I'm sure you've all seen a woman take off her skirt before. Um, a teenage woman. Me, I mean. Not that you've seen <i>me</i> do this...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_nothingtofear]: You don't have anything to fear from us, boss - but like I said, we're willin' to help if you still ain't certain.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_zip_stuck]*: I think the zip's stuck... Ah, thanks for offering to help, but please let me try first!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_stuck]: Oof, hell of a moment for it to get stuck. Maybe it's loose enough to pull it down now?

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_do_a_twirl]*: Oh no! The zipper broke. But, um, here I am. Sh-should I be doing a twirl or something? I don't really know what a man would like to see.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_dontworry]: Ah, well, I wouldn't worry too much about that.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_forthcoming_boobies]*: Oh... I haven't shown anyone before. Um, my, um... boobies. So I'm sorry if they're weird or something.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_breasts]: Well, um, if it helps at all, boss, I don't think the others will view 'em like that.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dont_brag]*: Please don't go bragging to your buddies that you saw me like this. Let's keep it a secret between just us here, okay?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_wontleaveroom]: Yeah, don't worry. This ain't gonna leave the room. -- Note from Arndress: We might be playing on the beach. I like this last sentence, but consider rephrasing for the same idea.

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hand_bra]*: I did it! Um, if it's okay with everyone, I'm going to use what I call a "hand bra". It's like a normal bra, but with my hands instead. I'm just not ready for a man to see my chest right now. I'm sorry. 
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_babysteps]: It's all good, boss. Just take it a step at a time, alright?


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_heart_racing]*: It's me. I knew it. I know it's only going to be my heart that's racing, but can we pretend for just a little bit?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_flow]: Hey, we're all happy to have you here, boss. Just... go with the flow, and you'll be fine.

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_go_with_the_flow]*: Go with the flow...<br>Go with the flow...<br>Go with the flow! -- Nagisa's 6-z_stripping pose has an intense expression
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_spirit]: That's the spirit - you got this, Nagisa!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_all_finished]*: I'm all finished. Sorry for making such a big deal of this. I was just so worried that you'd stop liking me...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_nothappening]: Heh, c'mon now - I can't see that happening even if I wanted to.

---

RAYNOR MUST STRIP GLOVES:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hello]*: H-Hello. My name is Nagisa Furukawa. It's nice to meet you, mister.
    OR [nagisa_jim_hello]: Hello. Maybe this is a bit late, but my name is Nagisa Furukawa. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Raynor.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_meeting]: Well, it's nice to meet you too, Miss Furukawa. Don't take this the wrong way, but you weren't exactly the type I figured I'd see at a place like this.

RAYNOR STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least no one from my school is here.
    OR [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least only one other person from my school is here. -- if Kyou or Sanako playing
    OR [nagisa_jim_age_here]*: I wasn't sure who I'd meet when I came here. I thought it might all be people my age, but at least not <i>everyone</i> here is from my school. -- if both Kyou and Sanako playing
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_agefamiliarity]: Yeah... though, if any of them showed up, wouldn't that kinda put both of you in the same boat?
    OR (if Kyou or Sanako is also there): True, but it might also be a bit more relaxing to have a familiar face here... 'long as this doesn't make things awkward when you get back.

RAYNOR STRIPPED GLOVES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_baseball]*: Do you play baseball. I mean... you don't know my dad, do you? Akio Furukawa?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_sports]: Heh, sorry to say, but nope. Demolition's the only sport I've really played, boss.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BANDOLIER:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_what_year]*: Mr. Raynor, I hope this isn't rude of me to ask, but what year were you born in?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_2470]: I was born in 2470, boss. Probably not a year that means much to you, does it?

RAYNOR STRIPPING BANDOLIER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_wrong_age]*: It's ~Month~ 2004 now, so that would make you, um.... thirty-four? Wait, 2470? Huh?!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_differentworlds]: Sorry, forgot about the whole "different worlds" nature of this place for a moment... I am thirty-four, though; nothin' incorrect there.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BANDOLIER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_twice_as_old]*: Haha, okay, as long as the result is right! So thirty-four? I was seventeen last year, so that's twice as old as I was then.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_eighteen]: Eighteen, huh... now that I think about it, there's a lot more folks around that age here than I expected.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BELT & HOLSTER:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dont_be_mad]*: Mr. Raynor, you lost that one. Please don't be mad...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_mad]: Mad? Wait... is there a reason you've been glancin' at my gun like that?

RAYNOR STRIPPING BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_real_firearm]*: N-No! I defintely wasn't looking at your gun! Or, well, it's just... I don't think I've ever seen a real firearm before. Except on TV.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_gangster]: Well, I promise you I ain't some crazy TV gangster type, boss. If I was, I don't think they'd have let me in with my gun in the first place.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_yakuza]*: You mean... you're <i>not</i> with the yakuza? I just figured with those dragon tattoos...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_yakuza]: Yakuza? Oh yeah, that was a term for organized crime back on Old Earth, right? Well don't worry - I don't like 'em any more than you.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_are_you_married]*: If you don't mind me asking, are you married, Mr. Raynor?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_widowed]: Well... no. I was once, but not anymore.

RAYNOR STRIPPING BOOTS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_sorry_for_prying]*: Oh, I'm sorry. I just had a question about, um... married people things. I didn't mean to pry.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_question]: Huh. Well, if it's just a general question, then I'd be willing to answer.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BOOTS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_finding_a_soulmate]*: It's just... do you think there's such thing as a soulmate? I don't know if I'll ever find anyone special, but you did you find someone like that for you?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_answer]: ...Truth be told, I don't know. I'd thought I found mine before, but after what happened, I ain't so confident no more.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SOCKS: (conditional on previous case)
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_made_sad]*: I don't know if this is a good time to say this, but sorry that I made you sad earlier, Mr. Raynor. I wasn't trying to.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_cametoterms]: It's alright, boss. I came to terms with it a while ago, and I can't let it bother me no more.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_her_loss]*: If she didn't appreciate you, it's her loss! I'm sure you'd be a very nice husband for any lady your age. You deserve someone who is right for you.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_chance]: Thanks. I'd like to hope the same - even if I can't help but wonder if that chance has already passed me by.

RAYNOR STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_not_too_old]*: You're not too old to find love, Mr. Raynor. That's what my mom would say. Because even though they've been married for years, my dad is always having to chase away customers who try to flirt with my mom.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_hope]: ...Heh, well, if you still believe in me, boss, then I guess that's as good a reason as any to hold out hope.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_work_out]*: Mr. Raynor, do you work out a lot?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_bestshape]: Sure do, boss. When fightin' in the Koprulu sector, it pays to stay in the best shape of your life.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SHIRT (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_peak_fitness]*: My dad told me that a man's peak physical fitness is in his thirties. But I thought he was just kidding around.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_fitness]: Some ages make it easier than others, sure, but if you ask me, there ain't no time to <i>not</i> be at your peak.

RAYNOR STRIPPED SHIRT (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_tickle_champ]*: You must be a tickle-fight champion!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_tickling]: Hah! Well, I don't know about <i>that</i> - my wife always seemed to have the edge over me with that, back in the day. -- I like the idea of Nagisa being an innocent and comforting enough presence that Jim's at the point now where he can talk about a memory of his wife like this without sadness.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP PANTS:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hide_my_eyes]*: Mr. Raynor, you didn't win that one, and you don't have much left to go. I'm sorry. I'll respect your privacy and hide my eyes for the rest of the game, okay?
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_squeamish]: Don't worry, boss, it's alright - I wouldn't have come here if I was squeamish about that anyway.

RAYNOR STRIPPING PANTS (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_too_awkward]*: O-Okay. I just didn't want anyone to feel awkward...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_awkward]: ...Well, I mean, you can still do it if you want. Not gonna force you to look or anything.

RAYNOR STRIPPED PANTS (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_if_you_insist]*: I-I'll look if you insist. As long it's it's not rude. Ah! Um. I looked. Sorry.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_lettingdown]: Right... sorry if I'm lettin' you down here.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP UNDERWEAR:
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_feel_safe]*: I won't pretend that I'm not nervous about it, but you've been really nice to me, Mr. Raynor. You've made me feel safe to~background.time~. So if you have to continue, it's okay. You have my support.
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_accustomed]: Well, I'm flattered to know that, Nagisa. But you don't have to worry - I think I've grown accustomed to it by now.

RAYNOR STRIPPING UNDERWEAR (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_chaperone]*: In a way, it's like you've been our chaperone to~background.time~. Um... until this part, I mean...
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_dontthinkaboutit]: Yeah... maybe I should try not to think about it too much.

RAYNOR STRIPPED UNDERWEAR (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_man_and_woman]*: You're a grown man. There's no reason to be ashamed of that. And I'm a woman... but we shouldn't think about that right now!
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_possibility]: Right, of course. Probably shouldn't think about the possibility of me losin' again, either.

---
DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Jim Raynor to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_softspoken]: You're pretty soft-spoken, aren't you, boss? Don't usually find folks like you at this kinda place - not that anyone minds, I'm sure.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_allowed_to_be_here]*: I'm definitely allowed to be here... They checked my ID at the door three times.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_demeanor]: Hey, I ain't accusin' you of breaking the rules or anything. It's just that strip poker and that sort of quiet demeanor don't usually go hand-in-hand.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_oh]*: Oh...

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_variety]: Well, I don't think anyone here's got a problem with it either way, boss. Variety's the spice of life, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_conversation]*: I hope so. I don't have a lot of experience, so I might not be able to add much to the conversation, but I'll try.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_differentfolks]: Gotten a good look around this place yet? I'm still pretty amazed by all the different types of folks here.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_perfect_place]*: When I heard the game as going to be played at the ~background~, I was pretty surprised. But actually, this is the perfect place to get all kinds of people together from different places! -- I've made a few special cases for this line where the phrasing doesn't work with the variable, but I used the same marker.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_colorful]: You said it, boss. I've been to a whole lotta different places, but none with a crowd quite as colorful as this.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_too_many_people]*: Do you think maybe we have too many people to~background.time~? Oh, I don't mean anyone should leave! I just thought it might be easier if one or two less people were here...

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_crowds]: Well, I ain't typically one for crowds, but I'm not gonna turn away people lookin' to have a good time either. The more the merrier, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dango_happy]*: Yeah, you're right! That's why the Big Dango Family are always so happy, now that I think about it!


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Dangofamily]: So what's this "Big Dango Family" you mentioned, boss? The name's got a bit of a crime group sound to it, but <i>that</i> can't be right.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_big_dango_crime_family]*: No, no, no, they're not a crime family! They aren't, right? Wait, what if the Big Dango Family are just a front for the yakuza?! It's the perfect cover.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_crimefamily]: I mean, you sound like you know this family well, don't you? I have a hard time imagining a crime group tryin' to get close to a sweetheart like you.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_miyazawa]*: You might be surprised! My friend Miyazawa in the library reference room is like a mom to all the gang members who climb in through the windows.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_crooked]: Well, best I can suggest is make sure you stay away from anything shady. I'd hate to imagine what this Dango Family's capable of if they really are crooked.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dango_shady]*: I'm in too deep! I'll have to protect the Big Dango Family's secret, no matter the cost!

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED JACKET:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_windowclimbing]: Gang members climbin' through windows, you said... Does that happen often at this school of yours?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_at_lunch]*: Not all the time! Usually just at lunch and after school.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT: (also conditional on nagisa_jim_miyazawa)
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Miyazawa]: Your friend, Miyazawa - you mentioned she's like a mom? She the school's librarian?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_charms]*: Miyazawa's a helper in the reference room. She also likes to help the students with magical charms. I'm not sure if I believe in that kind of stuff myself, but I could sure use one about now...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_ratskulls]: Sure never had a classmate doin' something like that where I grew up. Knew a couple boys who brought rat skulls for good luck, but the faculty didn't like 'em being displayed like that. -- Wasn't sure how to focus on the matter of Nagisa losing her shirt like I did with the left-right situation. If you want to do that again here I can change it, but this current line also offers the avenue of showing how different the world Jim grew up on is from Nagisa's.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_good_luck]*: D-Did it work? Did it bring them good luck? -- I figure Nagisa is trying to distract herself here by going on talking. I think this is more interesting that focusing on her clothes or her embarrassment. Plus even she might be willing to display a rat skull if it meant good luck in this situation!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_distracting]: Well, considering the stuff they pulled and seemed to get away with whenever they had 'em... then again, maybe it's just because they were more distracting. -- That's actually what I had in mind with lines like this - Jim essentially trying to ease her into the stripping aspect of the game by focusing her mind elsewhere. I did the same thing with the Komi-san interactions as well.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_lucky_skull]*: If the rats helped them believe in themselves, it sounds like it worked! But maybe there's something better for girls that's not a rat's skull...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_uniforms]: If you don't mind me askin', why does your school make you wear uniforms anyway? Back on Shiloh, they didn't care too much how we dressed 'long as we got our work done right.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_school_reputation]*: But how did you promote the reputation of the school, Mr. Raynor? Not that I'm... well... I'm probably not giving my school a very good reputation right now...

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major) AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_schoolspirit]: Truth be told, I never really thought about that much. Though I guess our teams in sports like Demolition probably helped with that.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_demolition]*: Sorry, I'm just having a little trouble getting this off. Um, maybe you could tell us how to play Demolition while I get my zip unstuck...

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major) AND WEARING DEFAULT OUTFIT:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Demolition]: Heh, Demolition's the best sport ever, boss. Folks drive around in weaponized hot rods tryin' to blow each other up - and advanced safety measures means almost no one gets hurt in it.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_safe_environment]*: If they're going to take risks, I'm glad they're doing it somewhere where they can feel safe and accepted and where nobody will laugh at them for losing...


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_nervous]: Well... how are you feelin', boss? Still nervous? -- By this point, Jim probably will have a harder time finding words, knowing how young and comparatively innocent she is in such a situation, but still wanting to make sure she's doing alright.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_girls_chests]*: Y-Yeah... I overheard some girls in my class say that boys like to see girls' chests no matter what they look like... I hope that's true, but I don't think I could handle it if people just wanted to make fun...

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_lookingout]: I don't think you have to worry. 'Sides, I'm lookin' out for you either way.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_game_dad]*: You've been kind of like a dad for me for this game, Mr. Raynor. But I don't want my dad looking when I have to show my, um, my boobies...

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_shuteyes]: Right. Don't worry, I'll shut my eyes for the time bein'.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_all_covered]*: Okay, you can open your eyes now. I'm all covered up. As much as I can be, anyway.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_sorry]: I, uh... sorry about this, boss.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_dont_be_sorry]*: Don't be sorry. I'm sure you did everything you could to help. If it's possible, I just have to be as brave as I can right now, even though know ~player.ifMale(guys are|a man is)~ watching...

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_happycompany]: Well... if it helps at all, I'm sure everyone here understands. We're all just happy to have your company.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_be_strong]*: I can be strong too.<br>H-Here I go!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_notsohard]: Now <i>that's</i> the spirit. It ain't so hard once you've got your mind set, is it?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hide_behind]*: Everybody seems to be happy for me, so that's nice. But it's still pretty hard. If it's okay, I might hide behind you every now and then, Mr. Raynor.

---

RAYNOR MUST STRIP GLOVES:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_gloves]: Think I'll go with my gloves first. Sorry if it ain't the most excitin' choice just yet. -- Kinda in contrast to Nagisa's earlier "must strip" line, where he's a lot more confident and casual out of the gate. Something she might see as interesting or even admirable?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_serious_player]*: It might not be exciting, but it makes a lot of sense. I could learn a lot from a serious player like you.

RAYNOR STRIPPING GLOVES (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_notserious]: Well, I wouldn't call myself a <i>serious</i> poker player or the like, boss. Hell, the strip poker scene's actually pretty new to me still.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_prepared]: Even so, you came prepared. You seem like a very capable person.

RAYNOR STRIPPED GLOVES (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_underestimating]: Heh, thanks; I certainly try. Still, I've got a feelin' underestimating you would be a mistake - especially for yourself.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_do_our_best]*: I haven't practised much, so I might not be much of a challenge, but let's both do our best!


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BANDOLIER:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_lookers]: Lotta good lookers around here tonight, huh, boss? Almost makes me feel bad I didn't come here wearing somethin' better.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_professional]*: You didn't need to dress up in a suit or anything, Mr. Raynor. You look very, um, professional!

RAYNOR STRIPPING BANDOLIER (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_professional]: Professional? Heh, if there's an upper-class profession out there that just requires a plain t-shirt and jeans, I'd sure like to know it.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_motorcyclist]*: I thought you were a professional... motorcyclist? I'm not sure, but you seem like a hard worker!

RAYNOR STRIPPED BANDOLIER (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_workethic]: Hah! Don't I wish? You're right about workin' hard, though - I'm proud to say I've had a strong work ethic ever since I was just a farmboy.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_farmboy]*: I'm having trouble imagining you as a farmboy! What did you used to farm?

RAYNOR HAND AFTER STRIPPED BANDOLIER:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_farming]: Hell, we farmed just about anything you can imagine, boss. Grain, fruits, vegetables, and a whole lotta livestock.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_farmgirl]*: That sounds like fun! Maybe if I was a farmer, I'd have big muscles too. Not as big as a man's muscles, of course. I'm not really sure how what kind of muscles a farmgirl can get.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BELT & HOLSTER:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_farmgirls]: You know, you shouldn't write off farmgirls that easily, boss. I've seen plenty of girls who got pretty jacked - enough to rival some men I know. --Though this might potentially lead to a funny bit where Nagisa gets a mental image of herself with big muscles
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_jacked]*: Wow! Do you think I could get "jacked" like you, Mr Raynor? But I would probably have to buy bigger dresses if my arms got really bulky like that...

RAYNOR STRIPPING BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_bulkingup]: I've seen plenty of girls not far from your age manage it. 'Sides, it could even give you a whole new kinda look, right?
        OR [Nagisa_bulkingup]: Thinkin' about getting bulked up now? Honestly, if you managed it, I'd be willin' to buy you the first new dress you need.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_inspired_to_bulk_up]*: Wow, really?! I think you've inspired me. I bet you can open any jar you want!

RAYNOR STRIPPED BELT & HOLSTER (accessory):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_lidterror]: Heh heh, that's true, boss. In a few months, you could be the terror of every lid you can imagine.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_groceries]*: And I could carry all of the groceries into the house in one trip!

RAYNOR HAND AFTER STRIPPED BELT & HOLSTER:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_fitnessclubs]: If you're seriously thinkin' about bulking up, there's a whole ton of places you could start. Your school probably has some fitness clubs or sports, right?
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_judo_club]*: Maybe I could ask the judo club for some tips. Thanks, Mr. Raynor!


RAYNOR MUST STRIP BOOTS:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Shiloh]: You know, folks back on Shiloh always loved to brag about how hardy we were compared to most other colonies. Wasn't sure myself how much of that was true and how much was just hot air.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hardy]*: Now that you've traveled, did you find out if it was true, Mr Raynor? Is everyone where you're from like you? I get winded just doing the yearly physical exam...

RAYNOR STRIPPING BOOTS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_dangerous]: 'Round the Koprulu sector, I think lots of folks are tough in different ways. It pays to be, given how dangerous it can be...
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_visit]*: Is it too difficult to visit? It must be hard to invite new friends to see the town where you grew up.

RAYNOR STRIPPED BOOTS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Koprulu]: I think Koprulu ain't too bad 'long as you got someone to show you where to go and what to avoid. Though with the current war goin' on, I wouldn't recommend it now.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_war]*: Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't know there was a war happening in your home country. Now I understand why you all need to stay strong.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SOCKS: (conditional on previous case)
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_war]: Truth be told, boss, war and Koprulu are kinda inseperable. Feels like each war's just led into a new one the past few decades.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_war_history]*: That's terrible. I never heard about this in History class, but I did miss a lot when I was home sick last winter.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_uglyhistory]: Don't think it's the kind of history anyone you know'd be familiar with. And frankly, I hope it stays that way.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_cooped_up]*: It's not healthy to keep all of your feelings cooped up inside. If you're suffering, I'm sure we'd all be willing to do what we can to make you feel better. Right, everyone?

RAYNOR STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_sentiment]: Well... thanks, Nagisa. I appreciate the sentiment.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hug_offered]*: And, um, I could give you a hug if you like. Hugs always cheer me up.

RAYNOR HAND AFTER STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_sinners]: Aww, man... Startin' to think you're too good for any of us sinners here, Nagisa.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_people_who_love_us]*: I'm not that special, but we all have people who love us. Don't forget that.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Earth]: Well, however things are goin' in Koprulu, I hope it's at least much better back on old Earth, boss.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_natural]*: Earth is doing great! It's springtime, and it's the month for cherry blossoms again. Natural things are so lovely.

RAYNOR STRIPPING SHIRT (revealing chest):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_Earthbiomes]: That's good to hear. Funny... never really thought much about how Earth looks. I only know it's so different from region to region.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_hilly]*: Some places are hilly and others are bare. Not everywhere looks like where I come from.

RAYNOR STRIPPED SHIRT (revealed chest):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_sights]: Makes sense. A place like that oughta have all sorts of sights - plenty of beautiful ones, too.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_surprising_places]*: Beauty can be found in surprising places sometimes!


RAYNOR MUST STRIP PANTS:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_outofpractice]: Damn, I must be more outta practice than I thought. Been a hot minute since I last played any cards with the Raiders.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_raiders]*: ... D-Do you play strip poker with the Raiders a lot? It must be really weird for you seeing them take their pants off. I mean, if you're not used to it...

RAYNOR STRIPPING PANTS (major):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_stripping]: Well, not the strippin' type. Actually, I'm still relatively new to it here.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_never_seen_before]*: Do your best! You have to stay strong for the sake of the game, even if you have to see things you've never seen before...

RAYNOR STRIPPED PANTS (major):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_uncomfortable]: Don't take me for bein' uncomfortable, boss - it's just taking some gettin' used to, is all.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_it_does]*: Yeah... it sure does.


RAYNOR MUST STRIP UNDERWEAR:
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_stuckaround]: If you don't mind me sayin', I'm impressed you stuck around this long, boss. Wasn't sure if you'd lose your nerve sooner.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_a_mans_thing]: When the game started and you got cards too, I knew there was a chance I might see a man's... thing. But I think it's only fair we accept out punishment for making you lose...
    OR [nagisa_jim_a_mans_thing]: When the game started and you and ~player~ got cards too, I knew there was a chance I might see a man's... thing. But I think it's only fair we accept out punishment for making you lose...

RAYNOR STRIPPING UNDERWEAR (revealing crotch):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_punishment]: In all seriousness, I hope this doesn't feel <i>too</i> much like a punishment. Don't wanna start makin' you feel uncomfortable.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_the_hard_part]*: It's... it's okay. I don't blame you or anything. This is just the hard part, that's all...

RAYNOR STRIPPED UNDERWEAR (revealed crotch):
Jim Raynor [Nagisa_turnaround]: Well, hopefully things will turn around now. Though they'll have to turn around quite a bit, really.
Nagisa [nagisa_jim_big_heart]*: <i>(It's huge! They're erect when a man's blood gets pumping, right? Mr. Raynor does have a big heart, so maybe it makes sense that he'd be pumping a lot...)</i>
