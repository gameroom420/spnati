If Nagisa to left and Reimu to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n1]: It's me. Um, should I say something? It'll be a pleasure working with you all. Thank you in advance for everything.
Reimu [NagisaShoes1B]: Wow, Nagisa, you're so polite and cheerful. And you seem like a hard worker. I should have expected stiff competition from my rivals for love!

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n2]: Ah, do you think someone here will fall in love with me? I'm... I'm not really here for that. But I'd be very flattered...
Reimu [NagisaShoes2B]: Even better, because that means less competition for me! Wait, then why <i>did</i> you come here? Do you get off on showing your body?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n3]: N-No! I'm not into that kind of thing... Are those my only two options? Okay, I'm looking for love after all. I'm definitely not here to show off.
Reimu [NagisaShoes3B]: You seem awfully confused, Nagisa. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were possessed. It's fine if you really are out for romance.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n4]: Again? I'm not sure if I should give a speech. Um, d-does anybody else like... socks? Don't you wish you could wear white every day? I do, but only on my feet...
Reimu [NagisaSocks1B]: Hm, if you want to wear white more often, maybe you should become a shrine maiden. A maiden as cute as you would surely bring more visitors to the shrine!

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n5]: Me?! A shrine maiden? But I haven't even been to shrine maiden school...
Reimu [NagisaSocks2B]: There's no school for it, Nagisa. I was born into it as the daughter of the Hakurei clan, but… eh, I can just chuck the uniform onto you and you'll do fine.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n6]: Maybe I could be a shrine maiden in the evenings after school then. Do you know if they allow sick days?
Reimu [NagisaSocks3B]: I guess? I close up the shrine whenever I'm sick… or hungover… or don't feel like working. It's not as if I get tons of visitors anyway.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n7]: I'm glad that you're all nice people. I was a little worried that the invitation to come here might have just been someone playing a trick on me.
Reimu [NagisaJacket1B]: Were we supposed to have an invitation? Well, whatever. I don't know of any youkai who lure in their victims with invites like that, but you should still be careful, Nagisa.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n8]: You're right, Reimu. I shouldn't let my guard down. Sometimes if someone's trying to pull a prank on you, they don't tell you until the last minute.
Reimu [NagisaJacket2B]: You'd be lucky if you only encounter a prankster, like a fairy. Youkai are the truly terrifying ones, and will eat you whole! Or steal your soul! Or slip you counterfeit bills!

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n9]: That's terrible! If one of those counterfeit bills gets spent at a mom-and-pop store, some poor family might have to go hungry. It's basically stealing!
Reimu [NagisaJacket3B]: Yeah, imagine <i>if</i> someone crammed your donation box full of bills that turned out to be leaves. …I oughta exterminate that Tanuki ringleader next time I see her.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory) AND PLAYING WITH A CHARACTER WITH THE FAIRY TAG:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n9_youkai]: Th-They do?! Um, w-we're not playing with youkai right now, are we? ~fairy.ifMale(He|She)~ wouldn't be interested in eating someone like me... right?
Reimu [NagisaAfterJacketYoukai_resp]: You don't have to worry, Nagisa. If any youkai tries anything bad, I'll just exterminate them.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n10]: Oh, it's me. I'm... I'm not really that good at stuff I haven't tried before...
Reimu [NagisaShirt1B]: You're worrying over nothing, Nagisa. When I go out to resolve an incident, I never put any thought into it, and things always turns out fine.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n11]: But... but Reimu, that's how I got into this whole mess! Are you saying that's the way I can get out of it too?
Reimu [NagisaShirt2B]: Of course, it's easy! When an incident starts, I just pick a direction and head straight, fighting anyone in my way. Eventually I always find the culprit!

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n12]: In this case, the culprit is me. I brought me here, and I lost. So... well, I guess it's only fair you get to take a look at my bra...
Reimu [NagisaShirt3B]: There's no culprit here because there's no incident, Nagisa. An incident is a terrible thing, because it always inconveniences me or makes me look bad.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n13]: I'm really sorry, but I'm going to be down to my panties in just a second. But you don't have to look if that kind of thing is weird to you...
Reimu [NagisaSkirt1B]: Don't worry, Nagisa. It's true I've only ever worn bloomers, but I've met enough girls from the outside world that panties aren't strange to me anymore! 

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n14]: J-Just because you meet a girl doesn't necessarily mean she's going to show you her underwear. Unless... well, I seem to find it more difficult to make friends than most girls do. T-They... they wouldn't... would they?
Reimu [NagisaSkirt2B]: What kind of friends do you think I'm making? When we go to the hotsprings, we all get undressed in the changing room, right? 

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n15]: So I'm not being weird. This is just a changing room. Except ~background.if.indoors(we're playing poker|it's not a room)~ and ~background.if.exhibition(I don't even know how many people are watching|I'm the center of attention)~... So... just a little weird.
Reimu [NagisaSkirt3B]: Hm, good point, Nagisa. I suppose we're making new friends here we wouldn't usually make. I'm having fun, though, so I don't mind.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n16]: Oh. It's me... Could I ask a favor of everyone? I know you might be a little disappointed when you see my chest. But, um, if you could praise me for trying, that would mean a lot to me.
Reimu [NagisaBra1B]: No one will ever respect you or your breasts just by asking, Nagisa! You need to have confidence in yourself. Barring that, throw needles and talismans at anyone who criticizes you.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n17]: I'm sorry. It's wrong of me to try to tell you how to react. I'll just... I'll just do it because I promised myself I would! I wouldn't even respect myself if I backed down now.
Reimu [NagisaBra2B]: That's the spirit! No matter how many continues I have to use, I always defeat my enemy and resolve the incident. Anything else would be too infuriating to accept!

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n18]: Thank you for trying to encourage me, even if it was in your own unique way.
Reimu [NagisaBra3B]: I-it's not like I care about encouraging anyone. I'm just saying what's true! …And, um, you do have nice breasts, Nagisa.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n19]: Eeep. Um, you won't tell anyone I was here, will you? ~background.if.exhibition(I'm not sure how many of you there are, but I hope you can all keep a secret...|This can be a secret just between us, right?)~
Reimu [NagisaPanties1B]: If anyone breathes a word of this, I'll exterminate them! It'd be terrible for my otherwise sterling reputation if this got leaked to the villagers back in Gensokyo!

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n20]: O-Okay... I... I trust you!
Reimu [NagisaPanties2B]: Ehe, you'd never see a sight as lovely as this in Gensokyo. At least not from a girl as cute as Nagisa!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_n21]: ... I don't really deserve any praise at all. But, um, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate it...
Reimu [NagisaPanties3B]: Praise is nice, but it won't keep you warm at night the way a lover will. Well, I'm sure someone here wants to snuggle up with you. At least, I do!

---

REIMU MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r1]: Your shrine maiden uniform is so beautiful, Reimu! But won't they miss you at the shrine while you're here?
Reimu [NagisaShoes1B_resp]: On the off chance someone actually <i>does</i> stop by my shrine, I left the donation box open. So it's not a problem for me.

REIMU STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r2]: Come to think of it, I didn't even know shrine maidens were allowed to play games like this. But I don't really know if it's an official rule or anything.
Reimu [NagisaShoes2B_resp]: It's fine, so long as this doesn't get back to the human villagers in Gensokyo. I need to maintain my good standing with them so they continue patronizing the shrine.

REIMU STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r3]: I've never even been to Gensokyo, so your secret's safe with me!
Reimu [NagisaShoes3B_resp]: That's for the best. Someone as sweet and trusting as you, Nagisa, would likely get eaten by a youkai within minutes. Or worse, scammed by one!


REIMU MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r4]: Reimu, did you say you were from Gensokyo? Which prefecture is that in? If it's around here, I don't think I've heard anyone mention it.
Reimu [NagisaSocks1B_resp]: Prefecture? Um, I wouldn't know. It's sealed off from the Outside World by a magic barrier, so it's not easy to get to by normal means.

REIMU STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r5]: Oh, I hope you can find your way home then. If we can find a personal computer later, maybe we can print you some directions from MapQuest.
Reimu [NagisaSocks2B_resp]: You don't need to draw a map, Nagisa. The border is controlled by this gap hag named Yukari. I pestered her into bringing me, and she’ll take me back after the game. I'm… not actually sure where "here" is.

REIMU STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r6]: I don't have the address, but I'm pretty sure they call this place the... um.... ~background.term~?
Reimu [NagisaSocks3B_resp]: Well, it doesn't really matter where I am. What matters is that someone here is looking for a beautiful bride!

REIMU STRIPPED SOCKS (minor) AT CLASSROOM BACKGROUND:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r6_classroom]: This is just my classroom, so I didn't have to come very far. I can give you the address if you'd like to call Ms. Yukari later.
Reimu [NagisaSocks3B_resp_classroom]: Why are we playing this game in your…? Well, it doesn't really matter where I am. What matters is that someone here is looking for a beautiful bride!


REIMU MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r7]: Sorry, but it's your turn again, Reimu. Um, do you really think this is a good place to look for love? How would you know if ~player.ifMale(he|they)~ really liked you for who you are? Maybe ~player.ifMale(he|they)~ just got excited to see you undress...
Reimu [NagisaShirt1B_resp]: I expect my future spouse to get excited for that, Nagisa. Carnal attraction is important for a marriage. And then once they get to know me, they'll fall even deeper in love!

REIMU STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r8]: I suppose that makes sense. But wouldn't you get embarrassed auditioning so many people with your ~clothing~ off? I think for me, I'd like to get to know someone really well before I asked them if they had, um, carnal attraction to me.
Reimu [NagisaShirt2B_resp]: Your way takes time and energy. "Work smart, not hard,” I always say! My mentor Kasen kept going on about what a bad idea this is, but she must be jealous of my mind for efficiency.

REIMU STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r9]: You're very pretty, so I'm sure nobody minds. If anything, you might get <i>too</i> many people falling in love with you.
Reimu [NagisaShirt3B_resp]: Hehe, you get it, Nagisa! Keep complimenting me like that, and <i>I</i> just may fall for <i>you</i>!


REIMU MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r10]: I'm not really sure what we should do when a shrine maiden loses. Is there maybe a prayer or a blessing we could say to make it right?
Reimu [NagisaSkirt1B_resp]: I've been in hairier situations than this, Nagisa, so don't waste your prayers. <i>Buuuuuut</i> if you feel guilty, donations to my shrine are always appreciated.

REIMU STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r11]: I do have a little bit of money saved up. But I'm sure it would make you feel uncomfortable if I paid you for... um... defrocking. So it's probably better if you do it on a volunteer basis like the rest of us.
Reimu [NagisaSkirt2B_resp]: D-don't say such strange things! The donations would be for <i>your</i> guilty conscience. And I'd deserve them for all the work I do protecting Gensokyo!

REIMU STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r12]: Oh, I see! Well, it <i>would</i> make me feel better... How much would you normally charge to show your bloomers? Do you have a price list or something?
Reimu [NagisaSkirt3B_resp]: No, I don't mean… <i>Ugh,</i> for you, Nagisa, there's no need to donate. Consider my protection a blessing from the Hakurei shrine maiden.


REIMU MUST STRIP SLEEVES:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r13]: I've been wondering, Reimu. When a person donates money to a shrine, where does that money go?
Reimu [NagisaSleeves1B_resp]: It goes to me, of course. I need to buy food after all. Materials for the shrine's upkeep. Sake. Sweets. That sort of important stuff.

REIMU STRIPPING SLEEVES (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r14]: Oh, so it's sort of like your income. But what if someone has an extra special wish and puts in more? How does that person's thoughts get conveyed properly?
Reimu [NagisaSleeves2B_resp]: It would be improper for me to play favorites, Nagisa. That's why I put in the same amount of work, no matter how much money I receive! Oh, you should still drop in plenty, though.

REIMU STRIPPED SLEEVES (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r15]: Oh, I see. So it's kind of like when a bakery gives away its bread at the end of the day to people who can't afford much. Because everyone needs to eat the same amount, but not everyone can pay full price.
Reimu [NagisaSleeves3B_resp]: There's places that give out free bread? Uh, not that I need <i>charity</i> or anything. Just donations.


REIMU MUST STRIP SARASHI:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r16]: Oh. I hope you can forgive us. We're all on your side, I promise. It's just this game that's pitting us against each other.
Reimu [NagisaSarashi1B_resp]: It's fine, Nagisa. I'm always fighting girls in battles of bullets in Gensokyo. So long as you play by the rules, we can share a cup of sake afterwards.

REIMU STRIPPING SARASHI (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r17]: I think I'm starting to understand your feelings better, Reimu. You're trying to escape from your life in a dangerous neighborhood. That must be why you drink and why you want someone to whisk you away.
Reimu [NagisaSarashi2B_resp]: Gensokyo is dangerous to normal humans, but not me. I just don't want to have to fight. Um, only because it's so much effort to resolve incidents.

REIMU STRIPPED SARASHI (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r18]: Don't give up, Reimu! There are people who still love you. W-Who knows, maybe a certain someone fell in love with you just now. N-Not me. Someone else.
Reimu [NagisaSarashi3B_resp]: If anyone <i>did</i> fall in love with me, they'd better be upfront about it! I've had my fill of dishonest youkai, I don't want that from my spouse.


REIMU MUST STRIP BLOOMERS:
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r19]: They say if you bring true happiness to a person, you might get a wish from your heart granted. I think... I think that might happen for you Reimu...
Reimu [NagisaBloomers1B_resp]: Wishing hasn't made me rich, Nagisa, so I won't count on it now. I'll be satisfied if my plan works and stripping naked really does net me a lover!

REIMU STRIPPING BLOOMERS (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r20]: Maybe that's just how the magic works. If your wish is for a lover, this could be how you can make ~player.ifMale(him|them)~ truly happy. Unless... unless it makes ~player.ifMale(him|that person)~ have impure thoughts...
Reimu [NagisaBloomers2B_resp]: I told you, my spouse should have <i>some</i> impure thoughts. After all, where's the fun in getting married if you can't get up to any naughtiness?

REIMU STRIPPED BLOOMERS (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_nr_r21]: I think if it's true love, then sharing that is purest thing of all. But, um, yeah, this is all out of order, so what we're doing is pretty naughty...
Reimu [NagisaBloomers3B_resp]: At least I get to be naughty with you, Nagisa! Even if my wish doesn't come true tonight, I still had fun.

---
DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.
---

If Reimu to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Reimu [NagisaShoes1A]: Nagisa, you're so bright and cheerful. Too bright and cheerful. People only act like that when they’re up to some trickery, so spit it out.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n1]: I'm not up to anything, I swear! I'm not in the wrong place, am I? I was told this group welcomed inexperienced players like me...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaShoes2A]: Oh, I get it. You're also trying to nab a spouse for yourself! Cute and demure girls are always popular, and you've got the act nailed down.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n2]: Wh-What?! I didn't know we had to get married at the end of the game! But I guess it makes sense now that I think about it... Do they perform the ceremonies right here and everything?

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaShoes3A]: No one's getting married <i>right</i> away, Nagisa. But this game compresses all the highs and lows of dating into an hour. That's my ticket to wife city!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n3]: I wonder who's going to be assigned to be my partner... I hope they're nice.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS: (conditional on previous case)
Reimu [NagisaSocks1A]: Say, Nagisa… it sounded earlier like you didn't care about <i>who</i> you married. Are you really so unparticular about love?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n4]: I'm sorry, but that's not true, Reimu. If someone asked me to marry them, I'd take it very seriously, and I might even say no. If anyone ever wanted to marry a girl like me, that is...

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSocks2A]: <i>Hmph,</i> it doesn't matter to me if anyone wants to marry you. It's easier for me the less competition I have. …So why do you think no one would want you?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n5]: I'm not all that smart or pretty or funny... It's hard for me to make friends, so I can't imagine having ~player.ifMale(a boyfriend|someone interested in me in that way)~.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSocks3A]: You're pretty and you seem like a good girl, but you're more pessimistic than a poverty god. But I'm sure you'd be the sort of wife who could treat her spouse right.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n6]: Sometimes I like to daydream about what I'd do if I was someone's wife. Um, I mean like the stuff my mom does. Not the bedroom part...


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Reimu [NagisaJacket1A]: Oh, Nagisa, I have an idea! To boost your confidence, let's do a little roleplay. You'll be my devoted, cute wife, and I'll be your hard-working, beautiful wife!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n7]: Um, okay! I've never done this kind of roleplay before, so I might need some help. Are we at home or are we here?

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaJacket2A]: Home, of course. I'll start.<br><i>Ahem!</i> Welcome home dear! I relaxed all day! Do you want a bath first? Dinner? Or perhaps… <i>me?</i>
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n8]: Please feel free to have the first bath, Reimu! I can get started on dinner now if you like.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaJacket3A]: Um, wait. I thought <i>I</i> was the housewife… Also, you're supposed to pick the "me" option. That's the code word for married couple lovemaking in all the stories I read.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n9]: Oh! L-Lovemaking isn't part of the roleplay, is it?

NAGISA HAND AFTER STRIPPED JACKET:
Reimu [NagisaAfterJacketLovemaking]: Don't worry, Nagisa! We'll wait until we're properly married for any hanky panky! But it's okay to imagine, right? Okay, we'll pick up the roleplay next time you lose!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n9_married]: <i>(I'm in over my head! This must be why dad told me not to be in too much of a rush to get married...)</i>


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT: (conditional on previous roleplay)
Reimu [NagisaShirt1A]: Okay Nagisa, it's roleplay time again. <i>Ahem,</i> Dear, I love how you fawn over me and don't make me do chores. What's your favorite thing about me?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n10]: Ah! Umm...<br>I like how you're there to encourage me, even when times get tough. D-Darling.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaShirt2A]: Hm, wait, do I really do that…? Um, I like how you can drink more sake than an oni? I-is that something you do as my wife?<br>{small}This is harder than I thought.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n11]: Y-Yes! You're always making me feel special. Even when... even when I've been drinking! I'm sorry for letting you see me like that...

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaShirt3A]: <i>Sigh…</i> all I have to go on for how couples act are novels, and those skip the boring bits. Shame, I enjoyed having Nagisa as my cute pretend-wife.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n12]: It's the same for me; all I know about married couples is from my mom and dad and from TV. But this roleplay is kind of fun. And it's nice to be called cute, even if it's just part of the game.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT: (conditional on previous roleplay)
Reimu [NagisaSkirt1A]: It's too much of a pain trying to be the perfect wife. I'll just treat you like normal, Nagisa, and you can decide if you like me or not.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n13]: You don't have to be perfect, Reimu. I'm sure you'll find someone who loves everything about how you are right now.

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaSkirt2A]: Yeah, you know what? You get it, Nagisa. I'm the beautiful Shrine Maiden of Paradise! Why should I change for anyone? I'm fine as I am now!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n14]: But if even you can't find ~player.ifMale(a boyfriend|someone special)~, regular girls don't stand a chance out there.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaSkirt3A]: <i>Urk—</i> now that I think about it, plenty of girls my age from the village are getting engaged already. It must be that everyone's just too intimidated to pursue me.<br>{small}Yes, I'm sure that's it.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n15]: Y-Yeah... me too. I... I can be pretty intimidating, I think.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Reimu [NagisaBra1A]: Nagisa loses! Be brave, and remember that once you get married your wife will want to stare at your boobs all the time.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n16]: A-All the time? I know whoever I marry will want to see them, but I was thinking... just a little peek sometimes.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Reimu [NagisaBra2A]: I think that'll be hard, Nagisa. From the surely reputable books I read, married couples go at it constantly. Making love at all times, in every room!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n17]: E-Every room?! They wouldn't! I don't think that would be allowed. There has to a limit, right?

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Reimu [NagisaBra3A]: Don't worry! My shrine is small, so there aren't that many rooms. We'd finish up after an hour or two. 
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n18]: W-What?! Um... ah... I... I don't think I can exercise for that long, Reimu! So I couldn't possibly!


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Reimu [NagisaPanties1A]: It's time, Nagisa! This is your holy of holies. What every guy and girl dreams about seeing one day. Hot springs don't count!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n19]: I know people are excited to see it... b-but that's why I'm so embarrassed to show it!

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Reimu [NagisaPanties2A]: Embarrassed or not, it's my right as the victor to see yours! It's like when you finally unwrap the box of sweets you've been hiding away.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n20]: H-Here's your prize!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Reimu [NagisaPanties3A]: Ehe, it's just what I wanted to see. You'll make someone <i>veeeery</i> happy with that. Maybe even me!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_n21]: I'm not used to all this flattery. T-Thank you, everyone. I'm happy that I could make all of you happy.

---

REIMU MUST STRIP SHOES:
Reimu [NagisaShoes1A_resp]: Is it even worth the effort to take off my shoes? I suppose I have to remove <i>something</i> to satisfy you all.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r1]: Please don't go to any trouble just for our sakes. I can't speak for everyone, but I'd be happy with anything. Maybe you could just tell us a story or buy everybody a juice box.

REIMU STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaShoes2A_resp]: All that stuff you suggested sounds like even <i>more</i> effort than kicking off my shoes, Nagisa, so no thanks. Don't you like taking it easy too?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r2]: Yeah... But someone taught me that it's worth pushing myself to go to new places and try new things. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't even be here.

REIMU STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Reimu [NagisaShoes3A_resp]: I've never really done… sexy stuff before. Gensokyo, where I'm from, is pretty old fashioned. Only youkai would play indecent games like these.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r3]: Please feel free to go at your own pace. I haven't really done anything like this before either, so we're in this together!


REIMU MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Reimu [NagisaSocks1A_resp]: I'm glad Nagisa's here. She's so inexperienced and earnest I know she'll be okay with anything I take off.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r4]: I'm okay with it, but you should consider the feelings of everyone at the table. Your hair looks so soft and shiny, so maybe there's someone who's looking forward to seeing you let it down.

REIMU STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSocks2A_resp]: I'm not taking off my hair ribbons here, I'd look too plain without them. Yukari even once told me they were “iconic” or something.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r5]: Oh, I understand. That's your personal decision, so I can respect that. But I'm sure you do have beautiful hair under your ribbons.

REIMU STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSocks3A_resp]: Thanks for noticing my silky black hair, Nagisa. If you keep telling me what a fine catch I am, I might just fall for you!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r6]: Who, me? I-I don't think I'm the right girl for you, Reimu...


REIMU MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Reimu [NagisaShirt1A_resp]: I should take off something impressive to <i>really</i> catch your eyes. Be sure to praise me a lot for this!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r7]: Of course, Reimu! Getting praised for doing hard things is something everybody appreciates.

REIMU STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaShirt2A_resp]: I wish people in Gensokyo recognized my efforts. All everyone does is criticize or lecture me. That's why I need a cute wife who will compliment me.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r8]: My mom says you shouldn't get married to try to fix your problems. Otherwise you'll just bring your problems with you. You have to work on yourself first before you're ready to support someone else.

REIMU STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaShirt3A_resp]: I don't have any problems. It's everyone else who is unreasonable in their expectations, or who causes trouble for me. <i>You'd</i> never cause an incident or make me train, would you Nagisa?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r9]: Me? I don't think you can change a person. You just have to love them for who they are.


REIMU MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Reimu [NagisaSkirt1A_resp]: I'd never show off my bloomers in Gensokyo, but if you don't adapt you'll be left behind. I used to be the only shrine maiden in town, but now I've got real competition.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r10]: That's true. Fun things, happy things, they'll all eventually change someday.

REIMU STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaSkirt2A_resp]: Though, it is a pain having to change your ways. It's hardly my fault that everything happened that did. <i>You</i> think I'm just fine as I am, right Nagisa?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r11]: Yep! You're fine as you are! Though I'm sure there are little things you'd like to work at getting better at. I'm going to work at being better at card games.

REIMU STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Reimu [NagisaSkirt3A_resp]: I don't like to <i>work</i> at anything… but I guess I would like to dispatch youkai with less trouble, or get donations effortlessly. Well, I'm sure I'll get better at that stuff just naturally anyway.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r12]: I'm sure you'll be able to get better at anything you set your heart on. We all just need practice, that's all.


REIMU MUST STRIP SLEEVES:
Reimu [NagisaSleeves1A_resp]: You know, maybe it's more trouble than it's worth trying to adapt to every little thing. If it happens, it happens, but why force change when you're as lovely as us?
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r13]: So you mean we should just enjoy things in the moment and not worry about the future?

REIMU STRIPPING SLEEVES (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSleeves2A_resp]: Nagisa gets it! Why worry about tomorrow's hangover when tonight's sake tastes so sweet? I'm sure everything will work out for me anyway!
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r14]: You don't want to have any regrets. Oh, but maybe sometimes the regret is not drinking the sake? Is it really that sweet?

REIMU STRIPPED SLEEVES (minor):
Reimu [NagisaSleeves3A_resp]: Sake's great, Nagisa! The sweet style is called <i>Nigori Sake</i> and isn't filtered as much as typical dry sake. There's all kinds!<br>{small}The best sake is the bottle someone else brought to the party, of course.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r15]: If it's good, maybe I'll try some when I turn twenty. That's how old you have to be where I'm from.


REIMU MUST STRIP SARASHI:
Reimu [NagisaSarashi1A_resp]: Ugh. Speaking of sake, I could go for a cup right about now. Would make this a lot less embarrassing… for me.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r16]: I understand where you're coming from, Reimu, but you shouldn't use alcohol to drown your troubles! Now more than ever you need to be making good decisions.

REIMU STRIPPING SARASHI (revealing chest):
Reimu [NagisaSarashi2A_resp]: Deciding to drink sake is usually my favorite decision to make… but you're right. It'd be terrible if whoever I married didn't look nearly as ~player.ifMale(handsome|beautiful)~ when I was sober.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r17]: Uh huh. Though I think anyone can look ~player.ifMale(handsome|beautiful)~ if you love them enough. It wouldn't be fair to ask them to be as nice as a pretty shrine maiden like you are.

REIMU STRIPPED SARASHI (revealed chest):
Reimu [NagisaSarashi3A_resp]: Looks aren't everything. It's more important whoever marries me knows how to compliment me like you do, Nagisa. 
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r18]: Aw, you don't have to say that, Reimu. I'm just telling you the truth.


REIMU MUST STRIP BLOOMERS:
Reimu [NagisaBloomers1A_resp]: No need to worry, this is all part of the plan. The plan for someone to fall in love and marry me! …It had better be working.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r19]: I'm sure there's no way that ~player.ifMale(any boy|you-know-who)~ could stop ~player.ifMale(himself|herself)~ from falling in love with you, Reimu. But... but maybe ~player.ifMale(he's|she's)~ just too shy to propose right now.

REIMU STRIPPING BLOOMERS (revealing crotch):
Reimu [NagisaBloomers2A_resp]: W-well, if anyone's still shy at this point in the game, they had better get over it right now. My bloomers are it for me.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r20]: ~player.ifMale(He's|She's)~ probably waiting until you two are alone until ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ confesses. But I'm pretty sure ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ likes you.

REIMU STRIPPED BLOOMERS (revealed crotch):
Reimu [NagisaBloomers3A_resp]: Don't wait too long! You might have to fight off all the suitors that just fell for me!<br>{small}Plus it'd be humiliating if I wasn't wanted at this point.
Nagisa [nagisa_reimu_rn_r21]: <i>(Reimu and ~player~ would make such a nice couple. I hope ~player.ifMale(he|she)~ really does confess to her.)</i>
