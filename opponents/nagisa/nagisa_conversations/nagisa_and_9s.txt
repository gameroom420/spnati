Some exchange brainstorming:
- Is violence the answer?
- Nagisa is maybe overly-trusting, whereas 9S has been burned by trust.
- Nagisa doesn't use much modern technology, plus she's from the distant past: 2004.
- "I think that gap *is* the topic of conversation. 9S's complete lack of understanding about basic human civilization is probably something we could wring out a few good lines from, and might even let me get some mileage out of Pod 153 (who acts as a talking database/encyclopedia)."
- "Another possible connection is “The Illusory World”. This is the story that Nagisa’s play is based off. In it, a girl lives alone on a dying world where nothing can be born. But she makes a robot doll out of junk to be her friend, and the two of them go on a trek. I’ve only played an hour or two of NieR:Automata, but I wonder if there’s enough there that Nagisa might have special sympathy for 9S’s situation." AND "The sworn enemies of YorHa, machine lifeforms, resemble primitive clockwork wind-up robots or Transformers-esque amalgamations of cobbled-together parts, and 9S is vehement about the superiority of androids to these lesser constructs."
- "9S has 0 sexual experience, even though he most likely has a thorough understanding of the mechanics behind it. As he explains, genitalia are not something that YorHa units are initially built with, but that many have had them installed later on. (IIRC this is actual word of god.) His are a relatively new addition, and he has yet to put the new systems to the test."
- simple pleasures: "9S has a personal fascination with human society. He has been known to daydream about what it would be like to be human, and will indulge in unnecessary physical activities, such as bathing, because he enjoys how they feel."
- "Reading the subtext of the game, he definitely understands what sex is. Androids as a rule seem to be a little sketchy on the concept of family, though dating does get brought up once or twice without confusion. So I'd say that the general human customs and taboos linking sex, dating, and marriage are probably a foreign concept for him." / His goal in playing "is meant to be a learning/data collection experience."
- If 9S wants to know about students and schooling, Nagisa could help.



If Nagisa to left and 9S to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_9s_n9_n1]: It was me who lost, wasn't it? I'm going to do my best to play smarter from now on. And if I can't... it's not like you let me play because I know everything about this kind of stuff.
9S []*: ?? -- note from Arndress: I thought it could be fun to use this conversation thread for 9S to question Nagisa's on increasingly-sexual topics outside his knowledge base, started by one ambiguous comment that could make 9S think Nagisa must be an oracle of all wisdom on these topics. This would help 9S learn about human relationships and push Nagisa out of her comfort zone as well. The crazier the question, the better, but it will be more believable if we started small.
