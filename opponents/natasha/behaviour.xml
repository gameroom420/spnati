Also, at least for me, the game doesn't continue until I finish what I had to say, so I'm holding up the game for everyone else too. And if you actually bothered to read all of this in the dialogue log, the joke is still on you for being that much of a bozo for dialogue that you'd make sure you've read &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;, even long-winded trolls like this. &lt;i&gt;Bozo.&lt;/i&gt;</state>
