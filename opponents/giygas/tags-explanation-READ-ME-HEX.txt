For the purposes of tags, Giygas has three states:
 A. Stage............0: “Alien State,” Giegue/Earthbound Beginnings Giygas.
                Has an alien-looking physical body, intelligible, of sound mind, an evil genius space warlord person guy.
 B. Stage..........1-5: “Specter State,” Giygas as he appears in Earthbound.
                Incorporeal red swirly screamy mindfuck thing. His own mind is basically destroyed. (In source material, anyway -- this is dialed back the teensiest bit for SJNATI, but not enough
                to make a difference for tagging reasons.)
 C. Stage 6 (finished): “Missing State,” Giygas has died and fizzled completely out of existence. (Think Pot of Greed post-forfeit).
                Poses for this stage are completely empty (or consist only of a gift box left behind), and all dialogue is Earthbound narration stating the player has won, giving level-ups to Giygas’s
                opponents, and stating (at Game Over) that the war against Giygas is over.

All-stage tags, and explanations:
 - black_sclera, exotic eyes: Has red eyes with black sclerae in Alien State, has black empty eyes in Specter State.
 - alien, non-human, space: A space alien and never appears human.
                            Appears obviously alien in his Alien State, and although his Specter State doesn’t have the classic look, it’s still well-established that he is a space alien from Stage 0.
 - creepy: An intimidating, villainous alien in Alien State and a Lovecraftian mindfuck in the Specter State.
 - gloomy: Alien State: A mirthless, emotionally-broken villain sent to destroy humanity, haunted by the guilt of doing so when a human woman raised him as her own son. 
           Specter State: A screaming mess who sometimes talks about how “It burns” and is, conceptually, Shigesato Itoi’s childhood trauma given shape.
 - psychic: Has PSI powers.
 - villain: The main villain of Earthbound Beginnings and Earthbound.
 - mother_franchise, video_game, nintendo: From Earthboud Beginnings and Earthbound.
 - april_fools, joke_forfeit, no_genitals: Yes.

Alien State tags (stage 0 only), and explanations:
 - bald: Giygas never has any hair, but only his Alien State really has a head in the conventional sense. If bald doesn’t apply to Pot of Greed, it probably doesn’t apply to Spectral State Giygas.
 - red_eyes: Has red irises in this State specifically.
 - pale-skinned, unusual_skin: It’s paper-white.
 - skinny: Extremely.
 - tail: A very long one. His Specter state (particularly in stage 2) has what resembles a tail, but it’s very abstract and he doesn’t exactly have a body anymore to begin with.
 - pointy_ears: Long, very inhuman ears that go upwards and to a point. I consider it a toss-up between this and animal_ears since they evoke cat ears, so if you decide animal_ears fits better, go ahead.
 - aggressive: Openly states his intent to cast all Earthlings into darkness once he wins the game. In his Specter State, he stops making threats (he no longer has the capacity to), he just IS a threat.
 - indifferent: Lacks any nudity taboo (he wears no clothing) and only really cares about anyone stripping in that they’re losing (though an opponent masturbating grosses him out).
 - mean: Has no regard for anyone’s feelings, frequently talks down to opponents (even his “allies”), and has many lines calling Earth people “ugly Earthlings.”
         After this State, he doesn’t really have any unkind words among his insane ramblings.
 - serious: Finds little levity in the game and is focused on his mission (though he does tread into hammier territory about how he’s going to destroy humanity).
 - smart: A well-spoken evil genius who somehow masterminded every problem in Earthbound Beginnings. However, from stage 1 onward, he no longer appears intelligent at all.
 - mature: 80+ years old, and has the mind of such as well in Stage 0.
    “Your valor to stand against me calls to the deaf ears of an uncaring universe.”

Specter State tags (stage 1-5, and later except where otherwise indicated), and explanations:
 - spirit, supernatural: Not a ghost or undead, but has an obviously incorporeal presence.
 - insane: YES. One of the least sane characters ever written in fiction.
 * In general, personality tags go out the window here. Exceptions are creepy, gloomy, and insane. In this state, Giygas doesn’t really HAVE a personality anymore.

Missing State tags (stage 6 only), and explanations:
 - silent: Has no more spoken dialogue, only narration. Giygas is dead.
 - All tags from Specter State, EXCEPT:
 - TAG REMOVED - insane: It seemed appropriate to remove this tag and this tag only based on how characters would be expected to react to the insane tag.
                        That is to say, I wouldn’t expect his visible insanity to make other characters uncomfortable if he is no longer present and no longer saying or doing anything.

 * I have selected no sexuality tags - Giygas is written as asexual.
