Timeline
 - Late December 2022: Development on Giygas begins when Kiki Retzorg starts editing behaviour.xml by hand.
 - February 1, 2023: The prayer targets are conceived. 72 of them are written this day alone.
 - February 4: Kiki Retzorg draws the first pencil concept art for Giygas’s stage 0 poses in her notebook.
 - February 6: Giygas’s Z-layer is changed from -100 to -1001. This is so his sprites layer beneath any other characters’ speech bubbles, allowing him to cover the entire screen in his later stages without making most of the dialogue in the game unreadable.

Special thanks to:
 - FarawayVision, for helping out with CSS and finding out about the -1001 Z-layer trick, despite not knowing the identity of my April Fool’s project at the time.
 - BulletShock, for sticking his nose where it didn’t belong and ending up proving some extremely necessary art support in the last month of pre-launch development
 - MyMainAccIsANord, for providing some extremely necessary moral support in the last week of pre-launch dvelopment
 - The Frisk and Friends team, for writing dialogue CSS that I was able to heavily copy from
 - Shigesato Itoi and the rest of the Mother team
