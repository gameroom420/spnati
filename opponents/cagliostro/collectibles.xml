        <title>Cutest Golden Statue in the Skies</title>
        <subtitle>Everything's coming up Cagliostro!</subtitle>
        <text>This statue is not a simple one of goldâ€”it was constructed with alchemy in the image of the founder of alchemy herself, with close attention to the details in her clothes and delicate face. One can say that portraying the epitome of cute to this degree is a form of initiation in itself.
