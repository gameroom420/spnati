CHARACTER ADOPTION CLAUSE

    The author of this character will be automatically retired from being her active writer, and the character will be available for adoption by a new author, under ANY of the following circumstances:
     - The character receives no update for 180 days, with an absence of known extenuating circumstances.
     - There is an absence of any contact, including but not limited to character updates, to the Strip Poker Night at the Inventory development community from the author for 100 days.
     - The author is credibly confirmed to have been rendered unable to write for a permanent period of time; or an indefinite period of time, that can be safely assumed to be longer than 50 days; by means such as death, coma, or documented real-world disappearance. In the instance of death, it is requested that 3 days be given before the character is adopted, and that the character be returned to the author who died if the author at any point returns from the dead.

    A previous author may succeed a subsequent author and re-adopt the character an unlimited number of times, and may also request to return to writing or co-writing the character, though the current author(s) are not obligated to accept such requests.
    Any authors who succeed the original (Kiki Retzorg) may NOT modify the character adoption clause, except for with unamious approval from all current Strip Poker Night at the Inventory development moderators.
    The current author of this character may willingly retire the character at any time, allow anyone to adopt her, and/or choose a co-author or any number of co-authors at any time. However, the author of this character may NOT forbid the adoption or automatic retirement of this character.

    The order of who has priority to adopt this character in the case of automatic retirement is as follows, with the first (denoted with “1.”) being the person or people with the most priority who will be given the character if they so choose in a timely fashion (within 14 days of retirement) over everyone who follows on the list and so on:
     1. The character’s main artist, if there is one (originally, Richar).
     2. The character’s co-artists, if there are any, and ordered prioritizing the artist(s) who contribute the most art for the character.
     3. FarawayVision, if he does not fit the above categories.
     4. Anybody else who has written or co-written a Danganronpa character for Strip Poker Night at the Inventory. (In this case and henceforth, “writing a character” necessitates that the character has been present on the Testing Roster or Main Roster at some point.)
     5. Any artist or co-artist for a Danganronpa character in Strip Poker Night at the Inventory who has written or co-written at least one character for the game.
     6. Anybody who has played Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and written at least one character for Strip Poker Night at the Inventory.
     7. Anybody who has played another Danganronpa game, read a Danganronpa light novel, or watched Danganronpa: The Animation; and has written at least one character for Strip Poker Night at the Inventory.
     8. Chris “Faulerro” Tout, creator of Danganronpa Abridged Thing; though he is NOT to be approached unsolicited.
     9. Anybody else who has written at least one character for Strip Poker Night at the Inventory.
    10. Anybody who has been an artist or co-artist for at least one character, who has been present on the Testing Roster or Main Roster at some point, in Strip Poker Night at the Inventory.
    11. Anybody else with the Participant role (or a later equivalent) in the SPNatI Community Discord server (or a later equivalent).
    12. Anybody else with a role in the production of any official Danganronpa media; though they are NOT to be approached unsolicited.
    13. Anybody else.

    Finally, as a matter of tradition, it is requested that the names of any authors or artists be added as conditions to the special easter egg case with id 287 and oneShotId 220.
