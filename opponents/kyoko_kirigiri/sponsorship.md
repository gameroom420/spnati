# Sponsorship requirements for Kyoko Kirigiri
Welcome to my darkness.

# Guide for MOD QA
- You’ll want to keep this document and Kyoko’s behaviour.xml both open in a plain text viewer, IDE, or web browser.
    - While doing this, this document is designed for ease of use to use Ctrl+F.
    - Kyoko’s folders are complicated and one of the sponsorships used to be 158 lines on its own, so this is the recommended method.
- This document quotes example lines needed to fill each requirement (except cases of linecounts that are counted by the CE).
    - These lines are shown as they appear in behaviour.xml, and can be cross-referenced with Ctrl+F.
- Folders for each sponsorship except Tweetsie’s exist and can be viewed in the CE, but be advised these folders are not comprehensive.
- Good luck!

 - [X] 30 targeted lines where Kyoko investigates other characters, mainly by asking them questions.
	- Target: Sakura
		1. There’s something to be said about your disposition, ~sakura~. That scar doesn’t tell the story of a clean death…was it an accident?
	- Target: Yumeko
		2. …~Yumeko~. Do you frequent places like this?
		3. So, ~yumeko~, what brings you to play with less-moneyed people here? I don’t doubt you like the promise of nudity, but is that all?
		4. Friends?
		5. …~Yumeko~. If you don’t mind me asking about the specifics of what you and your friends get up to…
		6. So, have you already faced a penalty worse than what’s at stake to~background.time~?
		7. I figured. Any examples you’d— oh, that’s what you’re going with?
		8. I don’t suppose you’re still eager to tell one of those tales, ~yumeko~?
		9. I assume you didn’t lose that time. How did you pull it off?
		10. So, I gather the nudity is new for you? Any thoughts on the experience?
		11. So, I gather the nudity is new for you? Any thoughts on the experience, given what this hand means for you?
		12. Are you about to compare yourself to a monster? An insect? A small dog?
		13. I put my life on the line because I had to— to protect the living. That’s what it means to be a detective.&lt;br&gt;What do you stake your livelihood for?
		14. How far have you gone? How much have you suffered? …What have you inflicted on others?
		15. (Following the above) Nobody’s forcing you to answer. If you don’t want to talk, then don’t.
		16. I’m &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; interested in hearing what your idea of respect for someone’s life is, Yumeko Jabami.
	- Target: Aoi
		17. …How sensitive are your breasts, Hina?
		18. I’ve got to say, I never thought you’d do this so proudly. I’m exciting you, aren’t I?

		20. So, what part of my body are you most excited to see?
	- Target: Moon
		21. &lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; many times have you played this game, exactly?

	- Target: Rose
		23. So, you’re wearing a rose in your hair… Did you just put that in to~background.time~?

		25. In other words, you need to find a new flower every week?
	- Target: Kyouko
		26. So, ~kyouko_toshinou~, did you say you’re in college right now?
		27. I couldn’t help but notice that you’ve got the time to participate in games like this. Do you do a lot of reading in your major?
		28. I haven’t met many girls who collect them like that. Trying to become a manga artist yourself?
		29. What’s the topic of your circle? The only one I’ve heard about was a “Princess Piggles” circle one of my classmates at Hope’s Peak ran…
		30. I may be assuming too much, but you seem like the type to pour a lot of passion into your work. Do you sell your Mirakurun fan works?
		- I heard you mention something about there being other Mirakurun circles. How popular is it…?
		- Multiple boxes… You’d have been right at home at Hope’s Peak. Any authors you enjoy in particular?
		- Nishikyogoku… How would you describe her work?
 - [X] 10 generics that can work as question prompts.

## POLO -- 45/45, 100%

		- Major: 5/5
			1. Ehehe… Didn’t we just start a few minutes ago, ~name~?
			2. Ehe… Well, it’s not a bad look. (f)
			3. Don’t be afraid to model a few different angles, ~name~. I’m happy to gaze at your legs. (m, lower)
			4. So, you’re making me work for your ~revealed~? That’s not a problem. I can beat you again. (m, upper)
			5. Fortunately for you, you’re not naked yet. But I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; working on it. (f, enf/human)
		- Minor: 5/5
			6. The sight of ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~ on the ~background.surface~ is a good visual indication of your perfromance…
			7. What do you see, ~other~? &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; see progress.
			8. Hope you’re okay with the idea of losing your ~marker.V_revealed~, ~name~. Otherwise, I’d start playing better.
			9. Thought there might’ve been something like ~revealed.ifPlural(those|that)~ under your ~marker.V_clothing~. (Lower)
			10. ~Clothing.ifPlural(they’re not a|it’s not a)~ bad ~marker.V_revealed~.
		- Extra: 5/5
			11. You can only take off things like ~clothing.ifPlural(that|those)~ so many times…
			12. That’s fine with me. You’ll run out eventually, though.
			13. Ready to lose again?
			14. I hope you’re ready to lose more than that.
			15. That’s fine. Patience is a must in my career.
 - [X] 10 more generic lines for opponents stripping (during-strip stages?)
		- 10/10
			16. Your movements are acceptable.
			17. Go slowly if you like. My eyes are following your hands…
			18. I suppose I can use my thoughts, then…
			19. So, what were you listening to through ~clothing.ifPlural(those|the)~ ~V_clothing~? [headphones]
				- Note: This expands to "those headphones" or "the earpiece"
			20. I can accept your ~V_clothing~ as a symbol of this victory. [hair_decoration]
			21. That’s stretching the definition of “clothing” a bit, isnt it? [bag]
			22. Shorts like those are too bold for my own tastes, but I’ll admit those might have been helping you catch my eye… [shorts, female]
				- …You probably won’t have trouble with that &lt;i&gt;now,&lt;/i&gt; though.
			23. I don’t have any reason to mind when guys wear shorts. After all, they’re easier to take off. [shorts, male]
			24. This is certainly a more mundane sort of reveal than what’s in store for you later, isn’t it? [mask, not naked]
				- I figured you looked something like that.
			25. Cloth bindings are among the most versatile pieces of clothing. If you write a secret message on cloth, someone looking for it might not realize where it’s gone if you’re wearing it. [wrappings, not major/important]
			- I suppose it’s not written you can’t count those separately. I can’t judge you for being resourceful… [sleeves]
			- Try not to worry too much. For most of human history, the traditional swimsuit has been none at all. [swimsuit]
			- Let me know if you need any help getting out of that. [bodysuit] (different poses depending on male/female/attraction)
			- … (think) [gloves]
			- You sure you wouldn’t rather keep those on? (calmer) [gloves, self stage 8/10]

			27. ~Player~, I’m seeing the concern in your eyes, but this is an ordinary ~weekday~~background.if.day(| night)~ for me.
		- 2: Dumb
			28. It helps if you match the numbers.
			29. You might want to go for hands with two cards matching in number, ~name~…
		- 4: Submissive
			30. You’re so simple-minded, ~name~… Isn’t it cute how you thought you could outplay me?
			31. You’re welcome to try and cover up your body…if you can. I’ll be watching, ~name~. (enf)
			32. Go ahead. Try and hide it from me, ~name~. (enm)
			34. You don’t want to win this hand, ~sub~.
		- 2: Shut-In
			35. Go ahead, ~background.if.outdoors(bare yourself to the world|get naked for us)~. New experiences are good for the mind.
			36. It’s okay to say how glad you are you went out to~background.time~, ~shut_in~. 
		- 2: Chuunibyou
			37. ~Name~, right? I’ll be interested in seeing how just how big your vocabulary is.

		- 4: Gothic Lolita
			39. I can’t say I’ve ever seen a boy dress like that before.&lt;br&gt;You’ve got my attention, ~name~…
			40. …~Name~. You weren’t expecting to be able to keep that outfit on all game, were you?
			41. …~Name~. You’re not thinking you can make it this whole game in that outfit, are you?
			42. …I’ve never seen someone put that much effort into a look like that and still seem this ready to lose it. Let’s see what you have for us, ~name~.
		- 3: Goth
			43. You’d be surprised how often your look can benefit from a well-placed tie. I could even see ~punk~ pulling one off…
			44. A well-placed tie makes for a great addition to a number of outfits. I can even picture someone like ~punk~ taking advantage of one.
			45. I should commend your insight for thinking to include a tie in your look. They’re not just for the polite, honest type.
		- 2: Weapon
			- Two questions, ~name~. First: am I unarmed?&lt;br&gt;Second: how many things can you see that could be used as a weapon?
			- Think carefully.

		10. Memories make us who we are… When a memory is carved into your body, it’s always there to remind you of that. [smaller text, scarred, not hilbert]
		11. &lt;i&gt;(From the looks of things, ~male~ is popular with women. It probably won’t be hard to get him to let his guard down, then…)&lt;/i&gt; [seductive, not gay/reverse bi-curious]
		12. If you don’t mind, there’s something I’m deeply curious about, ~undead~. …What’s it like to die? [undead, not sakura/tae]

- [X] Raise filtered linecount to 350.

# UNUSED SPONSORSHPIS

## BLUEKOIN -- 20 lines
 - [ ] 20 lines for the opponent removing/removed extra/minor/major cases of the nature of leaning into Kyoko’s inquisitiveness and having her ask questions about what the opponent is taking off, things like "Do you wear that often?" or maybe "How long have you had that?"
		- Lingerie - if it’s special for tonight
			- Lingerie + seductive?
			- Lingerie + innocent?
			- A bold choice of underwear for someone like you, ~name~… Seems to me like you only wore that because you knew we’d see it. Are you expecting to lose?
				- Nonetheless, it’s quite cute.
		- Thong
			- Thong + innocent (shimakaze/paya)
			- If seduction is what you’re after, you could show your body off plenty just by losing… Did you dress to distract us, ~name~?
			- I wouldn’t normally expect someone of your character to make such a bold choice of underwear, ~name~. Is there something you know that I don’t?
		- Sarashi?
		- Masked?
		- Goggles?

## REMILLIA, LEGACY SPONSORSHIP -- 82/158, 51%
		Remillia counted 182 total lines for this sponsorship, and 87 for sexuality.
		My own recount of each requirement found a total of 158, with 63 for sexuality.
		These lines are enumerated with each of the three sections starting with 1.
### Sexuality (21/63):
- [ ] 5 lines per bust size (Chest Small, Medium and Large) where she shows at least some interest towards the size, the person who has the chest, or anything that isn’t her commenting on the game. Any stage.
	- [ ] Small: 3/5
		1. I wonder if those are as sensitive as mine… I can’t tell from looking alone. Just something to think about…
		2. …If you’d like to stand a little closer for a better comparison with mine, feel free.
		3. I don’t get what you’re concerned about. Your breasts look perfectly fine.
	- [ ] Medium: 3/5
		6. Any set is nice, but yours are…the composition, the areolae, the way they fall…they’re hard to look away from.
		7. You know, ~name~, courage is one of the thing that resonates with me the most when it comes to other people. …Seeing your body like this too isn’t bad, though.
		8. If you’d like to celebrate yours being bigger than mine, I’ll allow it…as a token of gratitude.
	- [X] Large: 5/5
		11. I’m curious, ~name~… With ones of your size, is there anything I’m missing out on?
		12. &lt;i&gt;Hmm&lt;/i&gt;mm…
		13. I might just have to pat you down for contraband, ~name~.
		14. …Impressive.
		15. &lt;i&gt;(Big breasts…cool.)&lt;/i&gt;
		- I’m content with my own slight frame… I can’t say I dislike seeing yours, though.
- [X] 3 lines for Visible (Crotch, Female) where she shows interest in it. Any stage -- can be specifically late game if you think that fits her personality most.
	- 10/3
		16. There’s nothing unusual about being enthralled by another woman’s figure, is there?
		17. So there it is… Honestly, it’s kind of cute that you left it like that to~background.time~.
		18. It’s funny. I’m looking at you right now…so why is it me I’m learning about?
- [ ] 15 more self masturbation generics. Rem has no idea how her "act" system works, but just plop them in there somewhere. Best if she’s actually showing interest/arousal.
	- 1/15
		- Act 1:
		- Act 2: 1
		19. I shouldn’t be… I wasn’t expecting to feel this much more roused from being watched…
		- Act 3:
		- Act X:
- [ ] 10 more generics for a masturbating female. Any stage, no filters.
	- 2/10
		34. … (shier)
		35. …I just switched from my own motion to ~name~’s, didn’t I?
		- Gentler. Catch your breath.
		- Firmer. I don’t see you stirring enough, ~name~.
- [ ] 10 more generics for a masturbating male. Any stage, no filters.
	- 5/10
		44. I’m enjoying watching you do this completely naked… It means I get to watch how every part of your body reacts to this.
		45. … (lust)
		46. No hard feelings, right? Except for…
		47. I don’t have any regrets in regards to my hands…except maybe that they’re not ~name~’s right now…
		48. I’m happy to make my own deductions, but feel free to tell me about the thoughts addling your brain, ~name~…
- [ ] 10 more generics for her After finished (self) stage
	- 1/10
		54. Don’t let me distract you. I’m only naked here.

### General (15/46):
- [ ] 10 hand=any play once lines where she talks about any of her hobbies, her detective work, the setting of Danganronpa (might be a mood killer), her likes/dislikes, etc
	- 5/10
		- Notice: Coffee is taken
		1. I’m glad I could be here to~background.time~…December tends to be one of my busiest months. I even take work on Christmas and New Year’s most years…
		2. You know… I took quite the liking to volleyball during high school. Sports involving throwing weren’t an option because of my gloves, but I could hit a volleyball just fine…
		3. You know, plant and human DNA mix frightfully well if you’re disturbed enough to know what you’re doing. I think &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; case wins being the most bizarre I’ve ever taken… (garden)
		4. I don’t investigate illegal gambling, by the way. Different detectives specialize in different kinds of crime… It’s dangerous to work outside one’s specialization.
		5. It’s very challenging to get away with a crime on sand. It takes several hours for foot or trackprints to fade, and it’s an important clue whenever they &lt;i&gt;aren’t&lt;/i&gt; there… (sand)
- [X] 5 hand=any play once lines where she talks about any of her friends, the fellow students that she knows, any romantic interests (Makoto?), etc
	- 5/5
		11. One of my upperclassmen in high school had a habit of carrying food around too…but somehow, he had an uncanny talent for falling beneath notice. They called him the Ultimate Spy…
		12. You know, this ~background.if.indoors(table|group)~ reminds me a bit of my time at Hope’s Peak Academy… Their unique admission policies meant I went to school with the leaders of a biker gang and a yakuza family.
		13. Gazing at the water reminds me of an old friend of mine. She’s…very passionate about swimming and athletics and general. She tried to sell me on putting protein powder in my coffee once…
		14. I have a…close friend who I should try to bring by next time. He’s considered unusually lucky, but…I don’t think he has the kind of luck that would necessarily help him out in poker.
		15. One of the talents Hope’s Peak Academy cultivated was the Ultimate Botanist, Santa Shikiba. Our indoor garden held his own cultivar of waste-eating flower…
		- I’ve heard my high school’s Ultimate Photographer actually ~background.if.inventory(comes here|plays sometimes)~. She’s even able to capture emotion in &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; face… I just hope she knows when to put the camera away.
		- &lt;i&gt;(I should keep quiet about this place to Hiro… No doubt he’ll be raving about “power spots” and “UMAs” if he hears I came here and played with ~opp1~…)&lt;/i&gt;
- [ ] 10 lines showing her more detective side. - 25
		- This is vague, but you can really use your memory system to your advantage here. Interrogating others playfully, bringing up articles of clothing that were previously forfeited, using personality filters to make comments to herself and remember who the person was -- this would really make her stand out, I think
		- The prompts???
- [ ] 3 lines per each clothing type (Extra, Minor, Major, Important) where she comments on the person stripping, instead of thinking to herself.
		- Good example would be "…You did have the chance to turn this game on its head and throw everyone off by making a bold choice right from the start, but taking your ~marker.V_clothing~ off first works too.", bad example would be stuff like "Already?" and "&lt;i&gt;(Off ~clothing.ifPlural(they go|it goes)~.)&lt;/i&gt;". Any case, 12 new lines at the minimum.
	- [ ] Extra (26-28)
	- [ ] Minor (29-31)
	- [ ] Major (32-34)
	- [ ] Important (35-37)
- [ ] 3 more Hand Quality generics (3 for each type of quality) that are not filters and are not bluffing. 9 new lines at the minimum.
	- [ ] Good: 1/3
		38. A close associate of mine refuses to drink anything but spring water and civet coffee. I can’t imagine developing expensive tastes like that…
	- [ ] Okay: 2/3
		41. You might find it surprising what people can get their hands on shopping online. For instance, you can’t legally get firearms in Japan, but you can get electronic rangefinders no-questions-asked…
		42. I promise I’m not cheating by hiding any cards on myself. If you doubt me, of course, you’re welcome to check.
	- [ ] Bad: 2/3
		44. I’ve always found enjoyment in traveling for work.&lt;br&gt;It’s a perk to get to visit places like this.
		45. In my line of work, I may need to do my job anywhere at any time. It’s difficult to relax even in a place like this, but…thank you for inviting me anyway, ~player~.

	- [X] Submissive &gt;2/2
		5. Go ahead. Try and hide it from me, ~name~.

		7. Go ahead, ~background.if.outdoors(bare yourself to the world|get naked for us)~. New experiences are good for the mind.
		8. It’s okay to say how glad you are you went out to~background.time~, ~shut_in~. 
	- [X] Chuunibyou 2/2
		9. ~Name~, right? I’ll be interested in seeing how just how big your vocabulary is.
		10. I’m not sure I understand the specifics of your powers, ~name~. Could you give us a demonstration?
	- [X] Yandere 3/2
		11. ~Name~… Listen. I’ve seen minds like yourse before. If you keep that kind of single-minded devotion to your idea of love, it’ll lead to disaster.
		12. When all your thoughts are about one person…you don’t think for yourself.
	- [X] Greedy 2/2
		13. You understand there’s no money being bet here~background.if.day(| tonight)~, right? Why this ~background.if.bar(table|game)~?
		14. Make sure this gets put somewhere safe, dealer. I’d rather my jacket go home with me than ~thief~.
 - [ ] 2 filtered lines each for these clothing tags: (Gothic Lolita, Scantily-Clad, Maid Uniform, Goth/Punk/Emo, Fake Animal Ears, Eyepatch, Jewelry, and Weapon). This amounts to 16 lines at minimum. Any case, any stage -- stripping/lost would be easiest, but anything else works too.
	- [X] Gothic Lolita (CELESTE) 4/2
		15. …~Name~. You weren’t expecting to be able to keep that outfit on all game, were you?
		16. …~Name~. You’re not thinking you can make it this whole game in that outfit, are you?
	- [X] Scantily-Clad 4/2
		17. I don’t mind. It’s not how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ revealed I’m focusing on…but how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ covered. May I see my next hand?
		18. If you’re starting to feel impatient, just think of how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ &lt;i&gt;covered&lt;/i&gt; instead of how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ revealed.&lt;br&gt;…Next hand, dealer.
	- [ ]  Maid Uniform (KIRUMI/UOZUMI) 1/2
		19. You’re not part of the staff here, are you? Let me know if you need to show me a closet…
		- 
	- [X] Goth/Punk/Emo (LEON) 3/2
		21. …I’ve never seen someone put that much effort into a look like that and still seem this ready to lose it. Let’s see what you have for us, ~name~.
		22. You’d be surprised how often your look can benefit from a well-placed tie. I could even see ~punk~ pulling one off…
	- [ ] Fake Animal Ears 0/2
		- Hidden mic in the ears??
	- [X] Eyepatch (FUYUHIKO) 2/2
		25. After all you’ve been through? I think you can do better than that, ~name~. (!chuunibyou)
		26. A game with such intimate stakes like this doesn’t seem like a good place to hold back your powers, ~name~. Do you really need that eyepatch? (chuunibyou)
	- [ ] Jewelry 1/2
		27. I don’t prefer to show myself so conspicuously, but you wear that look well, ~opp1~…
		- Jewelry as a way to carry money
	- [X] Weapon (PEKO) 2/2
		29. Two questions, ~name~. First: am I unarmed?&lt;br&gt;Second: how many things can you see that could be used as a weapon?
		30. Think carefully.

	- [X] Crotch will be visible
		1. &lt;i&gt;(~Name~’s doing it…)&lt;/i&gt;
		2. I’m ready.
		3. I’m very curious, ~name~. Let’s see…
		4. So, beneath your ~marker.V_clothing~ is…
	- [X] Small crotch visible
		1. …I’m sorry. I hope I haven’t been staring too long. I… Thanks for playing this game, ~name~.
		2. …It’s quite cute, ~name~. (allowed to like cute things)
		3. From behind, you’d like just like any other woman, right? But when you turn around… You’re something else, ~name~.
		4. …I understand women who prefer other women now. (self not bisexual)
	- [X] Medium crotch visible
		1. I’ve seen all sorts of people in my travels for work…but this is…new to me.
		2. There’s nothing better-understood than the human body. Yet it still holds mysteries to unravel…
		3. …All of the alternate explanations have just been eliminated. That’s a penis.
		4. Before we started, I was worried that I’d already gotten too used to seeing other women naked. …I’m not worried now.
	- [X] Large crotch visible
		1. …I’m really not sure what to say. I suppose…I’m glad you’re comfortable being yourself, ~name~.
		2.  That’s exactly what I thought it was. Yet I wasn’t sure I was ready to believe it…
		3. …I might be a little mesmerized.
		4. Ehehe… To tell the truth, ~envious~, I think I might be a little jealous of her too.
	- [X] Generic crotch visible (optional)
		1. Wide hips are often seen as a sign of fertility. I don’t know if that’s applicable for you, but…I can’t say they don’t flatter you all the same…
		2. I doubt I just so happened to be the only woman here who doesn’t have a penis. What do you all know that I don’t?
		3. How did this happen? I have a hard time believing this was a coincidence. Where’s &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; penis?
		4. Interesting…&lt;br&gt;…I’m staring, aren’t I?
		- This is an eye-opening angle…
	- [X] Must forfeit
		1. I’m sure we’ve got a lot of questions. Wouldn’t you rather your genitals field them?
		2. I’ve been hoping for a demonstration of your body. Will you be giving one?
		3. …I’ll admit my eyes have been spending a lot of time on one spot on you, ~name~. It seems your hands are due to do the same.
		4. …I believe we’re about to see how ~name~ handles her penis.
	- [X] Start forfeit
		1. I have a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of curiosity for you to satisfy.
		2. Whatever you’re about to do, I doubt you’ll disappoint me.
		3. Let’s see it.
		4. (!Sv) So, where are you starting…?
		- (!Sv) You’ve got more to work with than I do.
		- (Sv) Too bad I can’t share my techniques with you… But I’m sure you’ve developed your own by now, right?
			- Too bad I can’t share my techniques with you… Actually, you’d probably still enjoy that, wouldn’t you?
	- [X] In forfeit
		1. (!Sv) The techniques you practice on yourself would work on anyone, wouldn’t they?
			- Anyone except ~no_genitals~, wouldn’t they?
		2. (!Sv) So, does the…penile stimulation help with…making it easier to use your vagina?
		3. &lt;i&gt;(The way she moans as she touches it…I keep forgetting it’s her own…)&lt;/i&gt;
		4. What’s the most sensitive part, ~name~? I think I’d prefer a non-verbal answer…
		- I wouldn’t believe this… If you told me, I really wouldn’t have believed that so easily…
	- [X] In forfeit, heavy (optional)
		1. Your chest is heaving and…your penis is throbbing, ~name~…
		2. I’ve been anticipating this part. I want you to keep going, ~name~.

	- [X] Finished
		1. …I am &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; forgetting ~background.if.day(what I saw today|this night)~.
		2. You know, ~name~, I could collect a sample of that for analysis if you’d like to see if it’s any different than a man’s. I have connections in forensics…
		3. I don’t know how much I was expecting to come out…
		4. (!Sv) Your thighs…that’s quite the visual, ~name~.
		- (Sv) I know we’re focused on what just came out of you, but you’ve got a great voice for this, ~name~. Thanks for playing.
