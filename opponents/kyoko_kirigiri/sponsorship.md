# Sponsorship requirements for Kyoko Kirigiri
Welcome to my darkness.
Also, some of this markdown isn’t well-formed, sue me, I had to update it while using a busted projector or a computer I don’t own. I’ll make it nicer when it’s actually QA time.

# Guide for MOD QA
- You’ll want to keep this document and Kyoko’s behaviour.xml both open in a plain text viewer, IDE, or web browser.
    - While doing this, this document is designed for ease of use to use Ctrl+F.
    - Kyoko’s folders are complicated and one of the sponsorships used to be 158 lines on its own, so this is the recommended method.
- This document quotes example lines needed to fill each requirement (except Rem’s targeted linecount).
    - These lines are shown as they appear in behaviour.xml, and can be cross-referenced with Ctrl+F.
    - Each sponsorship marks each example line filling the minimum requirements for that sponsor with a unique bullet character:
        - Over-Fly:     Question mark.
        - Insiduani:    Percentage symbol.
        - Tweetsie:     Dollar sign.
        - BlueKoin:     Ampersand.
        - Polo:         At sign.
        - Remillia:     Asterisk.
    - The purpose of these unique characters is to have their Ctrl+F counts tally verbatim each line filling the minimum requirements.
    - Surplus lines, when included, do not use these unique characters.
- Folders for each sponsorship exist and can be viewed in the CE, but be advised these folders are not comprehensive.
- Remillia’s sponorship is split into three sections. All use asterisks.
- Good luck!

# INSIDUANI -- 10-15 lines
 - [ ] 10-15 hand lines containing questions or prompts. Follow up replies are encouraged, but not necessary.
    - 1/10 total
        - On hand line:
        - Undead
        % I’m a bit curious how the piercings affect your sensation there, ~female~… Perhaps you’ll demonstrate for us when you lose?
        % 

# TWEETSIE -- at least 16/40 lines, 40%
 - [ ] 30 targeted lines where Kyoko investigates other characters, mainly by asking them questions.
    - 16 (18?)/30
        - Target: Sakura
		$ There’s something to be said about your disposition, ~sakura~. That scar doesn’t tell the story of a clean death…was it an accident?
        - Target: Yumeko
        $ …~Yumeko~. Do you frequent places like this?
        $ So, ~yumeko~, what brings you to play with less-moneyed people here? I don’t doubt you like the promise of nudity, but is that all?
        $ Friends?
        $ …~Yumeko~. If you don’t mind me asking about the specifics of what you and your friends get up to…
        $ So, have you already faced a penalty worse than what’s at stake to~background.time~?
        $ I figured. Any examples you’d— oh, that’s what you’re going with?
        $ I don’t suppose you’re still eager to tell one of those tales, ~yumeko~?
        $ I assume you didn’t lose that time. How did you pull it off?
        $ So, I gather the nudity is new for you? Any thoughts on the experience?
        $ So, I gather the nudity is new for you? Any thoughts on the experience, given what this hand means for you?
        $ Are you about to compare yourself to a monster? An insect? A small dog?
        $ I put my life on the line because I had to— to protect the living. That’s what it means to be a detective.<br>What do you stake your livelihood for?
        $ How far have you gone? How much have you suffered? …What have you inflicted on others?
            - How far have you gone? How much have you suffered? …What have you inflicted on others?
        $ (Following the above) Nobody’s forcing you to answer. If you don’t want to talk, then don’t.
        $ I’m <i>very</i> interested in hearing what your idea of respect for someone’s life is, Yumeko Jabami.
        - Target: Aoi
        $ …How sensitive are your breasts, Hina?
        $ I’ve got to say, I never thought you’d do this so proudly. I’m exciting you, aren’t I?
    - Needs further tallying
 - [ ] 10 generics that can work as question prompts.
        - Overlaps with Insiduani’s sponsorship.
        - For instance, asking the table questions like "How exactly did you find the Inventory," or "What made you want to play the game", as generic examples.

# BLUEKOIN -- 20 lines
 - [ ] 20 lines for the opponent removing/removed extra/minor/major cases of the nature of leaning into Kyoko's inquisitiveness and having her ask questions about what the opponent is taking off, things like "Do you wear that often?" or maybe "How long have you had that?"
        - Lingerie - if it's special for tonight
            - Lingerie + seductive?
            - Lingerie + innocent?
            - A bold choice of underwear for someone like you, ~name~… Seems to me like you only wore that because you knew we’d see it. Are you expecting to lose?
                - Nonetheless, it’s quite cute.
        - Thong
            - Thong + innocent (shimakaze/paya)
            - If seduction is what you’re after, you could show your body off plenty just by losing… Did you dress to distract us, ~name~?
            - I wouldn’t normally expect someone of your character to make such a bold choice of underwear, ~name~. Is there something you know that I don’t?
        - Sarashi?
        - Masked?
        - Goggles?
		
# POLO -- 34/45 lines, 75%
 - [ ] 5 more lines for small/medium/large piece removed each (meaning extra, minor, and major)
        - Major: 1 (4)/5
            @ Ehehe… Didn’t we just start a few minutes ago, ~name~?
			@ Ehe… Well, it’s not a bad look. (f)
            @ Don’t be afraid to model a few different angles, ~name~. I’m happy to gaze at your legs. (m, lower)
            @ So, you’re making me work for your ~revealed~? That’s not a problem. I can beat you again. (m, upper)
		- Minor: (4)/5
			@ The sight of ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~ on the ~background.surface~ is a good visual indication of your perfromance…
			@ What do you see, ~other~? <i>I</i> see progress.
			@ Hope you’re okay with the idea of losing your ~marker.V_revealed~, ~name~. Otherwise, I’d start playing better.
			@ Thought there might’ve been something like ~revealed.ifPlural(those|that)~ under your ~marker.V_clothing~. (Lower)
			- (Feet???)
		- Extra: (4)/5
			@ You can only take off things like ~clothing.ifPlural(that|those)~ so many times…
			@ That’s fine with me. You’ll run out eventually, though.
			@ Ready to lose again?
            @ I hope you’re ready to lose more than that.
 - [ ] 10 more generic lines for opponents stripping (during-strip stages?)
        - 2 (3)/10
            @ Your movements are acceptable.
            @ Go slowly if you like. My eyes are following your hands…
            - I suppose I can use my thoughts, then…
 - [X] 20 more filtered lines targeting character tags of any kind. -- >20/20
        - 2: Creepy
        - 2: Dumb
        - 4: Submissive
            @ You’re so simple-minded, ~name~… Isn’t it cute how you thought you could outplay me?
            @ You’re welcome to try and cover up your body…if you can. I’ll be watching, ~name~. (enf)
            @ Go ahead. Try and hide it from me, ~name~. (enm)
            @ You don’t want to win this hand, ~sub~.
        - 2: Shut-In
        - 2: Chuunibyou
        - 4: Gothic Lolita
            @ I can’t say I’ve ever seen a boy dress like that before.<br>You’ve got my attention, ~name~…
            @ …~Name~. You weren’t expecting to be able to keep that outfit on all game, were you?
            @ …~Name~. You’re not thinking you can make it this whole game in that outfit, are you?
            @ …I’ve never seen someone put that much effort into a look like that and still seem this ready to lose it. Let’s see what you have for us, ~name~.
        - 3: Goth
            @ You’d be surprised how often your look can benefit from a well-placed tie. I could even see ~punk~ pulling one off…
            @ A well-placed tie makes for a great addition to a number of outfits. I can even picture someone like ~punk~ taking advantage of one.
            @ I should commend your insight for thinking to include a tie in your look. They’re not just for the polite, honest type.
        - 2: Weapon

# OVER-FLY-6494
- [ ] 21 filtered lines. (As of 2024-03-10)
		- 4/21 total, 19%
		? There’s…it’s so full… (intercourse_forfeit/tandem_mf)
		? …You’re committed to this, aren’t you? (clothing_destruction)

# REMILLIA, REVISED SPONSORSHIP -- 100%
- [X] Raise total linecount to 1740.
- [X] Raise filtered linecount to 350.

# REMILLIA, LEGACY SPONSORSHIP -- 81/158, 51%
        Remillia counted 182 total lines for this sponsorship, and 87 for sexuality.
        My own recount of each requirement found a total of 158, with 63 for sexuality.
## Sexuality (21/63):
- [ ] 5 lines per bust size (Chest Small, Medium and Large) where she shows at least some interest towards the size, the person who has the chest, or anything that isn't her commenting on the game. Any stage.
    - [ ] Small: 3/5
        * I wonder if those are as sensitive as mine… I can’t tell from looking alone. Just something to think about…
        * …If you’d like to stand a little closer for a better comparison with mine, feel free.
        * I don’t get what you’re concerned about. Your breasts look perfectly fine.
    - [ ] Medium: 2/5
        * Any set is nice, but yours are…the composition, the areolae, the way they fall…they’re hard to look away from.
        * You know, ~name~, courage is one of the thing that resonates with me the most when it comes to other people. …Seeing your body like this too isn’t bad, though.
    - [X] Large: 5/5
        * I’m curious, ~name~… With ones of your size, is there anything I'm missing out on?
        * <i>Hmm</i>mm…
        * I might just have to pat you down for contraband, ~name~.
        * …Impressive.
        * <i>(Big breasts…cool.)</i>
- [X] 3 lines for Visible (Crotch, Female) where she shows interest in it. Any stage -- can be specifically late game if you think that fits her personality most.
    - 10/3
        * There’s nothing unusual about being enthralled by another woman’s figure, is there?
        * So there it is… Honestly, it’s kind of cute that you left it like that to~background.time~.
        * It’s funny. I’m looking at you right now…so why is it me I’m learning about?
- [ ] 15 more self masturbation generics. Rem has no idea how her "act" system works, but just plop them in there somewhere. Best if she's actually showing interest/arousal.
    - 1/15
        - Act 1:
        - Act 2: 1
        * I shouldn’t be… I wasn’t expecting to feel this much more roused from being watched…
        - Act 3:
        - Act X:
- [ ] 10 more generics for a masturbating female. Any stage, no filters.
    - 2/10
        * … (shier)
        * …I just switched from my own motion to ~name~’s, didn’t I?
- [ ] 10 more generics for a masturbating male. Any stage, no filters.
    - 5/10
        * I’m enjoying watching you do this completely naked… It means I get to watch how every part of your body reacts to this.
        * … (lust)
        * No hard feelings, right? Except for…
        * I don’t have any regrets in regards to my hands…except maybe that they’re not ~name~’s right now…
        * I’m happy to make my own deductions, but feel free to tell me about the thoughts addling your brain, ~name~…
- [ ] 10 more generics for her After finished (self) stage
    - 1/10
        * Don’t let me distract you. I’m only naked here.

## General (14/37):
- [ ] 10 hand=any play once lines where she talks about any of her hobbies, her detective work, the setting of Danganronpa (might be a mood killer), her likes/dislikes, etc
    - 4/10
        - Notice: Coffee is taken
        * I’m glad I could be here to~background.time~…December tends to be one of my busiest months. I even take work on Christmas and New Year’s most years…
        * You know… I took quite the liking to volleyball during high school. Sports involving throwing weren’t an option because of my gloves, but I could hit a volleyball just fine…
        * You know, plant and human DNA mix frightfully well if you’re disturbed enough to know what you’re doing. I think <i>that</i> case wins being the most bizarre I’ve ever taken… (garden)
        * I don’t investigate illegal gambling, by the way. Different detectives specialize in different kinds of crime… It’s dangerous to work outside one’s specialization.
- [X] 5 hand=any play once lines where she talks about any of her friends, the fellow students that she knows, any romantic interests (Makoto?), etc
    - 5/5
        * One of my upperclassmen in high school had a habit of carrying food around too…but somehow, he had an uncanny talent for falling beneath notice. They called him the Ultimate Spy…
        * You know, this ~background.if.indoors(table|group)~ reminds me a bit of my time at Hope’s Peak Academy… Their unique admission policies meant I went to school with the leaders of a biker gang and a yakuza family.
        * Gazing at the water reminds me of an old friend of mine. She’s…very passionate about swimming and athletics and general. She tried to sell me on putting protein powder in my coffee once…
        * I have a…close friend who I should try to bring by next time. He’s considered unusually lucky, but…I don’t think he has the kind of luck that would necessarily help him out in poker.
        * One of the talents Hope’s Peak Academy cultivated was the Ultimate Botanist, Santa Shikiba. Our indoor garden held his own cultivar of waste-eating flower…
        - I’ve heard my high school’s Ultimate Photographer actually ~background.if.inventory(comes here|plays sometimes)~. She’s even able to capture emotion in <i>my</i> face… I just hope she knows when to put the camera away.
        - <i>(I should keep quiet about this place to Hiro… No doubt he’ll be raving about “power spots” and “UMAs” if he hears I came here and played with ~opp1~…)</i>
- [ ] 10 lines showing her more detective side.
        - This is vague, but you can really use your memory system to your advantage here. Interrogating others playfully, bringing up articles of clothing that were previously forfeited, using personality filters to make comments to herself and remember who the person was -- this would really make her stand out, I think
        - The prompts???
- [ ] 3 lines per each clothing type (Extra, Minor, Major, Important) where she comments on the person stripping, instead of thinking to herself.
        - Good example would be "…You did have the chance to turn this game on its head and throw everyone off by making a bold choice right from the start, but taking your ~marker.V_clothing~ off first works too.", bad example would be stuff like "Already?" and "<i>(Off ~clothing.ifPlural(they go|it goes)~.)</i>". Any case, 12 new lines at the minimum.
    - [ ] Extra
    - [ ] Minor
    - [ ] Major
    - [ ] Important
- [ ] 3 more Hand Quality generics (3 for each type of quality) that are not filters and are not bluffing. 9 new lines at the minimum.
    - [ ] Good: 1/3
        * A close associate of mine refuses to drink anything but spring water and civet coffee. I can’t imagine developing expensive tastes like that…
    - [ ] Okay: 2/3
        * You might find it surprising what people can get their hands on shopping online. For instance, you can’t legally get firearms in Japan, but you can get electronic rangefinders no-questions-asked…
        * I promise I’m not cheating by hiding any cards on myself. If you doubt me, of course, you’re welcome to check.
    - [ ] Bad: 2/3
        * I’ve always found enjoyment in traveling for work.<br>It’s a perk to get to visit places like this.
        * In my line of work, I may need to do my job anywhere at any time. It’s difficult to relax even in a place like this, but…thank you for inviting me anyway, ~player~.
        - 

## Misc (45/49)
- [X] Raise her general Targeted Lines counter in the CE from 331 (as of 5/20/2023) to 350.

        - Not including lines in this document since the CE counts targeted lines.
- [X] 2 filtered lines each for these personality tags: (Creepy, Dumb, Submissive, Shut-In, Chuunibyou, Yandere, and Greedy). This amounts to 14 lines at minimum. Any case, any stage -- stripping/lost would be easiest, but anything else works too.
    - [X] Creepy 2/2
        * Don’t worry about me, ~player~. I’ve seen stranger company.
        * ~Player~, I’m seeing the concern in your eyes, but this is an ordinary ~weekday~~background.if.day(| night)~ for me.
    - [X] Dumb 2/2
        * It helps if you match the numbers.
        * You might want to go for hands with two cards matching in number, ~name~…
    - [X] Submissive >2/2
        * Go ahead. Try and hide it from me, ~name~.
        * You’re welcome to try and cover up your body…if you can. I’ll be watching, ~name~.
    - [X] Shut-In 2/2
        * Go ahead, ~background.if.outdoors(bare yourself to the world|get naked for us)~. New experiences are good for the mind.
        * It’s okay to say how glad you are you went out to~background.time~, ~shut-in~. 
    - [X] Chuunibyou 2/2
        * ~Name~, right? I’ll be interested in seeing how just how big your vocabulary is.
        * I’m not sure I understand the specifics of your powers, ~name~. Could you give us a demonstration?
    - [X] Yandere 3/2
        * ~Name~… Listen. I’ve seen minds like yourse before. If you keep that kind of single-minded devotion to your idea of love, it’ll lead to disaster.
        * When all your thoughts are about one person…you don’t think for yourself.
    - [X] Greedy 2/2
        * You understand there’s no money being bet here~background.if.day(| tonight)~, right? Why this ~background.if.bar(table|game)~?
        * Make sure this gets put somewhere safe, dealer. I’d rather my jacket go home with me than ~thief~.
 - [ ] 2 filtered lines each for these clothing tags: (Gothic Lolita, Scantily-Clad, Maid Uniform, Goth/Punk/Emo, Fake Animal Ears, Eyepatch, Jewelry, and Weapon). This amounts to 16 lines at minimum. Any case, any stage -- stripping/lost would be easiest, but anything else works too.
    - [X] Gothic Lolita (CELESTE) 4/2
        * …~Name~. You weren’t expecting to be able to keep that outfit on all game, were you?
        * …~Name~. You’re not thinking you can make it this whole game in that outfit, are you?
    - [X] Scantily-Clad 4/2
        * I don’t mind. It’s not how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ revealed I’m focusing on…but how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ covered. May I see my next hand?
        * If you’re starting to feel impatient, just think of how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ <i>covered</i> instead of how little ~clothing.ifPlural(they|it)~ revealed.<br>…Next hand, dealer.
    - [ ]  Maid Uniform (KIRUMI/UOZUMI) 1/2
        * You’re not part of the staff here, are you? Let me know if you need to show me a closet…
        - 
    - [X] Goth/Punk/Emo (LEON) 3/2
        * …I’ve never seen someone put that much effort into a look like that and still seem this ready to lose it. Let’s see what you have for us, ~name~.
        * You’d be surprised how often your look can benefit from a well-placed tie. I could even see ~punk~ pulling one off…
    - [ ] Fake Animal Ears 0/2
        - Hidden mic in the ears??
        -
    - [X] Eyepatch (FUYUHIKO) 2/2
        * After all you’ve been through? I think you can do better than that, ~name~. (!chuunibyou)
        * A game with such intimate stakes like this doesn’t seem like a good place to hold back your powers, ~name~. Do you really need that eyepatch? (chuunibyou)
    - [ ] Jewelry 1/2
        * I don’t prefer to show myself so conspicuously, but you wear that look well, ~opp1~…
        - Jewelry as a way to carry money
    - [X] Weapon (PEKO) 2/2
        * Two questions, ~name~. First: am I unarmed?<br>Second: how many things can you see that could be used as a weapon?
        * Think carefully.
