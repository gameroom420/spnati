SPECIAL THANKS
Richar, for being a phenomenal artist, an absolute joy to work with, and honestly for making this whole project remotely possible
MyMainAccIsANord and FarawayVision, for helping me as I fumbled my way around the character editor
MyMainAccIsANord again, for helping me through the home stretch of writing before Testing Roster submission when I had way too many lines written and way too few generic cases covered
RubberCorgi, coolcat001100, and the rest of the SPNaTI Community Discord Server moderation team, for keeping my mischief in check
Onboro, for fostering my mischief
lil David, for labouring alongside me writing the complete OPPOSITE Kyouko
Cipher, for writing one of Strip Poker Night’s most technically-sophisticated characters (Fina) for me to steal, I mean borrow, some important code from
ThisIsMySinAlias for doing the posing on Sly Cooper, whose coding I copied because the coding for his arousal gimmick was WAY easier than what I had in mind to do for Kyoko’s
DonOuttaDan and Critfinyti, for being the pioneers of writing Ms. Kirigiri as a Strip Poker Night character
Every other writer and artist for Danganronpa characters in Strip Poker Night, for being my inspiration to make my contribution to the list
The writers and artists of all the characters Kyoko targets, and those of all the characters who target her or will target her in the future
All the rest of the SPNatI community, for contributing to one of the most positive, supportive, and helpful creative communities I have ever had the pleasure of being part of, for a pornographic game of all things
A friend of mine whom I will avoid naming for her sake, who graciously answered my questions about detective work as the family member of someone in the business
Another anonymous friend, who fooled me into getting into and falling in love with the Danganronpa series
Kazutaka Kodaka and the rest of the Danganronpa team
