                <state img="custom:#-happy">There's nothing better after a few minutes of personal fun than a cup of coffee. But right now I'm the mood for something a little more refreshing.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-bloom">So what did you think of my ability, ~player~? There's a lot more I can do, but I thought I'd take it easy this time to avoid alarming anyone here.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-butt" marker="butt3">Sitting on my leg is much more comfortable than any chair. Have you ever sat on someone's lap, ~player~? It's not unlike that.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-dominant">I know I'm usually not very expressive with my emotions, but if you don't believe that I had a good time feel free to take a look...</state>
                <state img="custom:#-calm">I'm feeling much more talkative than usual. I'm sure it won't last very long, but for now it's fine.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-happy">It's very uncommon, but after the events of to~background.time~ I might trouble focusing on my books tomorrow. Perhaps I'll simply close my eyes and go over the events of the game once again.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-bloom">When you possess an ability like mine, your perception of space shifts. It's a natural consequence of having everything in my line of sight be within my immediate reach. I can't deny it gives me a certain sense of dominance.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-butt" marker="butt3">I'll stand up in a minute. For now I'm still recovering my energy. You might think that having to support my weight this way would still be tiresome, but I've had a lot of practice.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-dominant">Mmmm... I think I could easily go for another round now. I prefer not to brag, but I do have quite a lot of stamina.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-giggling">Does anyone else likes to sit down without your feet touching the ground? Heh, it reminds me of when I was a young girl and I would use one of the adult chairs at the library.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-giggling">I hope my crew mates are not looking for me right now. It'd be a little difficult to explain, heheh.</state>

                <state img="custom:#-interested">My body still hasn't cooled down. It makes sense considering that wasn't just any masturbating session.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-serious">I'm curious if there are any kind of people that wouldn't be allowed in this place. It'd be quite sad for someone to join a game in which people don't show any interest in them.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-shocked">I completely forgot about digging into the nature of this place. What could its origin be? The way people from different places gather here is anything but normal.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-thinking">I wouldn't mind becoming a regular of this establishment, but as I'm constantly traveling with my crew that wouldn't be possible. Still, I'm not entirely clear on how one can &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; this place.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-thinking">If I play another game in the future, I hope my table has a few older players... I don't mean &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt;, but older than me would be ideal.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-winking">I thought I'd be the one educating others in this place, and yet in the end I was the one that learned something new about myself. I love it when things go unexpectedly.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-winking">There's always something interesting about people looking at my bare legs while I'm sitting. But I'm sure it's even better when I'm not wearing anything, and all I need to do is move them just a bit for them to see something &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; special.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-talking">I'm starting to regain my strength. I was feeling too weak to stand up right after climaxing.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-talking">I can't help but wonder what other sorts of sexual acts have taken place here besides masturbation. It doesn't seem like there are many rules in this game, so the catalogue might be quite extensive.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-curious">This must be without a doubt the strangest place in which I've ever masturbated, and yet I didn't think about it until now. It felt natural.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-curious">While masturbation is a beautiful thing, it's common to feel a sense of loneliness afterwards. Perhaps next time I won't have to be by myself.</state>
                <state img="custom:#-serious">There are women who have quite a bit of trouble experiencing orgasms. If one of them lost this game, the others might be in for a long wait.</state>
