    <description>Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. She is the sole survivor of the destroyed island of Ohara. She is currently the only person in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government. She ate the Flower Flower Fruit, a Devil Fruit which allows her to produce her body parts on any surface including her own body, other bodies, and other objects, allowing her to create copies of them.</description>
