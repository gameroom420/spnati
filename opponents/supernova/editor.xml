        <note id="217">I'm actually interested in exploring this idea now. Maybe she could partner up with other versions of herself? Or find some way to limit the amount of work for her?</note>
        <note id="219">With 'sports games' I mean things like FIFA. Video games that have you playing a simulation of real-life sports.</note>
        <note id="220">Is creating new universes something people can just... do in Pokémon?</note>
        <note id="221">Is this what Team Galactic is trying to achieve? Re-creating the universe?</note>
        <note id="223">For some reason, I couldn't target Marinette directly, so I just targeted females with the Miraculous tag instead.</note>
        <note id="224">I don't know exactly how Ribbon Girl's floating ability works, and neither would Supernova probably, so I just generalized it to "you can fly".  Also, who would have more fighting experience, a superhero or a professional boxer?

I marked it "FightingExperience", but feel free to respond to "you can fly" instead, if you want. It's up to you.</note>
        <note id="246">I actually haven't come up with the full story here yet. All I have right now is a vague idea that she's once needed to take an action which directly resulted in someone's death, because the alternative would have been worse, and there would have been no other way to prevent that alternative from happening.

Well, technically, it *did* happen, in some worlds, because that's how the multiverse works. Her goal was to make sure there were also worlds where it *didn't* happen. Unless it's on the scale of the entire multiverse.

I still need to come up with: 
- Who she's killed
- What would have happened if she didn't (which would probably qualify as some kind of apocalypse)
- Why there was no other way to prevent that from happening
- How exactly she did it. (Currently "teleported into a black hole" is the preferred option for me)

I don't know why I'm writing all of this down. You're probably never even going to see this.</note>
        <note id="256">Polly seems like the kind of person who would show her how recreational drug usage can be safe and fun. I would love for this conversation to turn out that way, even with the problems there have been surrounding Polly's mentioning of drugs.

Also I wrote this in the notes before we had our discussion about maybe adding it to the Valentine's epilogue.</note>
        <note id="257">This is a reference to a specific book I read, called "The Time Traveller's Wife", in which the main character, Henry DeTamble, has a condition where he spontaneously and involuntarily travels through time. The condition is at one point referred to as "Chrono-Impairment". I think it's also got a movie, but I haven't seen that.</note>
        <note id="278">These lines are based off of various Undertale AUs. Karbol wrote them for me.</note>
        <note id="279">This guy is actually real. Look him up if you have the chance. He's really cool.</note>
        <note id="284">This case changes her intelligence to Best, which will last until either she or Chara is out of the game.</note>
        <note id="286">I might want to set something up so the next game they're together, she recognizes Chara right away and starts off at Best intelligence, but Supernova doesn't really have persistent memory like Chara has. I'll need to figure something out.</note>
        <note id="287">This turns her intelligence back to what it was, since she's already won against Chara.</note>
        <note id="291">This case changes her intelligence to Best, which will last until either she or Chara is out of the game.</note>
        <note id="295">I might want to set something up so the next game they're together, she recognizes Chara right away and starts off at Best intelligence, but Supernova doesn't really have persistent memory like Chara has. I'll need to figure something out.</note>
        <note id="296">This will only play if Supernova beat Chara in a previous game, and will prevent the whole determination thing from happening twice in a row.</note>
        <note id="327">I know this isn't the direction we talked about, but I would like to see how Wheatley responds to such a ridiculous claim as "you turned GLaDOS into a potato, but it hasn't happened yet".</note>
        <note id="328">I actually came up with several uses for her powers in a fight with supervillains, but I couldn't find a way to cram it into a reasonably-sized line.

- Punching someone from behind using a portal, then quickly warping out of range again.
- If the opponent has a gun or rockets or something, use portals to redirect the shots back towards themselves.
- Opening up a portal right under their feet, so they fall through (maybe straight into prison?)
- Using a portal to grab items from other locations that can be used to attack or defend.
- Dropping heavy items through portals onto the enemy's head.
- Calling in the help of other superheroes and instantly transporting them to her location.
- Instant retreat, if needed.
- Escaping when captured.</note>
        <note id="329">If you're wondering what she's saying, she's trying to introduce herself in ☰↜§€٭ .</note>
        <note id="330">Asking how he's going to masturbate without any genitals or, for that matter, a body.</note>
        <note id="344">I'm actually thinking about making this happen, now. It would take another custom animation, though.</note>
        <note id="345">I think she has a generic line somewhere talking about the exact same thing. I guess the assumption "stars on clothes = wizard" is not that uncommon.</note>
        <note id="346">As Supernova is an OC, I don't think Wikipedia has any information on her, but maybe the concept of teleportation or something.</note>
        <note id="347">AI generated lines:

Even if we don't win them all, I still feel a weird sense of accomplishment, and I think it might be a bit too late to let that drop.

"Gotta make another round with this guy before it gets worse, bro."

Oh, okay, this is the most... unusual place I've ever been

The other world I played with my girlfriend on slow days last week had the same problem.

I don't have to play that long before I can win, eh?

Anyway, I won this game.

Good bye! And maybe this time I might get some gold instead of the more expensive silver.

This round is really, really slow. Is it because &lt;i&gt;I'm not good enough or &lt;i&gt;it

I'm not sure where those hands are.

A few more rounds and I'll be just fine with this one!

I'm not the only one making bad hand now, that's for sure.

This hand is my number one hand!

My hand has come in for an absolute crushing surprise, I think.

I really, really, really like this game, I feel good about it.</note>
        <note id="348">I know there's anime and stuff where people naturally have crazy hair colours like purple, but she's from a place where everyone has "normal" hair colours, except for her.</note>
        <note id="349">The god in question is Zoe, who isn't in the game yet, and who evidently somehow escaped. Supernova doesn't know that unless she actually meets Zoe in SPNatI, though. </note>
