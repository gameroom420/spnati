        <note id="217">I'm actually interested in exploring this idea now. Maybe she could partner up with other versions of herself? Or find some way to limit the amount of work for her?</note>
        <note id="219">With 'sports games' I mean things like FIFA. Video games that have you playing a simulation of real-life sports.</note>
        <note id="220">Is creating new universes something people can just... do in Pokémon?</note>
        <note id="221">Is this what Team Galactic is trying to achieve? Re-creating the universe?</note>
        <note id="223">For some reason, I couldn't target Marinette directly, so I just targeted females with the Miraculous tag instead.</note>
        <note id="224">I don't know exactly how Ribbon Girl's floating ability works, and neither would Supernova probably, so I just generalized it to "you can fly".  Also, who would have more fighting experience, a superhero or a professional boxer?

I marked it "FightingExperience", but feel free to respond to "you can fly" instead, if you want. It's up to you.</note>
        <note id="246">I actually haven't come up with the full story here yet. All I have right now is a vague idea that she's once needed to take an action which directly resulted in someone's death, because the alternative would have been worse, and there would have been no other way to prevent that alternative from happening.

Well, technically, it *did* happen, in some worlds, because that's how the multiverse works. Her goal was to make sure there were also worlds where it *didn't* happen. Unless it's on the scale of the entire multiverse.

I still need to come up with: 
- Who she's killed
- What would have happened if she didn't (which would probably qualify as some kind of apocalypse)
- Why there was no other way to prevent that from happening
- How exactly she did it. (Currently "teleported into a black hole" is the preferred option for me)

I don't know why I'm writing all of this down. You're probably never even going to see this.</note>
