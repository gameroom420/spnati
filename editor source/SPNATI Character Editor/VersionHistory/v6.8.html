<h3>Metadata</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds the option to add a name to the default costume.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds "Not Tag" and "Tags (Advanced)" dialogue conditions.</li>
    <li>Adds a Reference Skin dropdown for stage conditions. This allows the user to choose which costume's clothing the Stage dropdowns show the names of, for easy reference when targeting alt costumes. <b>Important: This doesn't do anything to the line itself. If you want a costume condition, you still need to add a Player: Costume test or a costume Tag filter.</b></li>
    <li>Adds the "@" operator for markers, which checks if a marker is in a given range.</li>
    <li>Adds a "Refresh Images" button, which refreshes the pose dropdown. Use this after adding new poses - previously this required restarting the CE entirely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costumes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allows costumes to skip layers by selecting the new clothing type "skip". Please consult more experienced users before trying to do this!</li>
</ul>

</ul>
