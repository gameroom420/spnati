<h3>Programmable Image Pipeline</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added the ability to create vertices on wires to allow for more clarity in layouts. Click anywhere on a wire and drag to add a vertex. Right click a vertex to delete it.</li>
	<li>Added Text, Cookie Cutter, Apply Mask, Threshold, and Brightness/Contrast nodes.</li>
	<li>Added Sub-Pipeline nodes for embedding one pipeline within another.</li>	
</ul>


<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Prevented pipeline nodes from being dragged off the workspace into an unrecoverable location.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where pipeline nodes that were dragged while the workspace was scrolled would appear in the wrong place when reopening the pipeline editor.</li>
	<li>Fixed visual artifacts while scrolling the pipeline editor workspace.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where you could not define two pipeline assets with the same key across different sheets in a pose matrix. Note this only applies to pipeline asset sheets. Normal sheets will still overwrite the same filename, as this is intentional behavior.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where duplicating a pipeline (via Save As) would not properly duplicate node connections.</li>
</ul>
