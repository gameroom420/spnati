<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds functionality for forfeit operations in the Advanced Dialogue Options window. A given line can now manipulate stamina, forfeit timer, or forfeit redirects, as well as the heavy-masturbating state. See the documentation for more details.</li>
    <li>The image preview now correctly shows custom poses exclusive to costumes.</li>
    <li>The image preview now shows custom poses with the correct height.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pose Matrix</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adds a checkmark button that marks the selected cells as imported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validator</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flags lines with weight 0, since weight 0 does not behave as expected.</li>
    <li>Checks more robustly for lines with the whole line as {small}.</li>
    <li>No longer warns for {!reset} at the end of a line, since it doesn't actually do anything bad per se.</li>
    <li>No longer warns for Self Saying Marker, Self Saying Text, or Self Pose if the case is hidden and has negative priority.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixes a bug causing data recovery backups to never be deleted. <b>This will take effect, on a per-character basis, the first time you save the character in this version, which may cause an unusually long time for that save to complete.</b></li>
    <li>Fixes the Pose Maker sometimes corrupting image file paths.</li>
    <li>Fixes some issues with image attachments in the Pose Matrix.</li>
    <li>Images are now properly considered to be uncompressed if they were compressed but then modified later.</li>
    <li>Gives KKL more time to respond to commands, which should fix some importing issues.</li>
</ul>
