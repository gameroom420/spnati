            Metadata defines characteristics about the character that will assist players in finding your character on the selection screen. This includes their name and selection screen image along with information for the filters, such as their size, gender, tags, and so forth.

                <li><span class="label">Height:</span> How tall the character is. This data is currently useless.</li>

                <li><span class="label">Origin:</span> Source material (game, anime, movie, etc.)</li>

                <li>
                    <span class="label">Intelligence:</span> Determines how well the character plays.
                    For player enjoyment's sake, you should try to balance AI and number of clothing layers. Bad AI with too few layers will lose too quickly too often, and good AI with too many layers will be frustrating to try to beat.
                    <br />You can specify different AI levels per character stage. A level will be used until the next listed stage is reached. For example, if you have two rows, 0-bad and 4-good, then your character will start with bad AI, but at stage 4, they will start using good AI.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="label">no-swap:</span> The character never swaps any cards (for extreme situations, e.g. they lost their glasses, they're unconscious, they left entirely, etc.)</li>
                        <li><span class="label">throw:</span> The character purposely tries to lose.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">bad:</span> The character randomly trades cards.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">average:</span> The character makes a decent effort to build a good hand. The majority of characters use this level.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">good:</span> The character goes for what's most probable to win a hand (without resorting to cheating).</li>
                        <li><span class="label">best:</span> Very similar to good, but slightly better.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><span class="label">Phases to finish:</span> After a player has lost a hand while naked, they must masturbate. This value controls how many times the player has to click buttons before the character "finishes."</li>
