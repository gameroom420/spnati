Ever find yourself losing hours of progress? Do you ever agonize after spending eons posing your character only to notice a glaring flaw in your model once you’re finished? Well, no more! After learning many hard lessons, I’ve developed a few methods to make the kisekae art process more efficient and ^^almost entirely fool-proof!

Thanks to these methods, posing Emi’s alternate skin took me minutes instead of hours.

## Run-down:

**Posing Spreadsheet:** Organize your poses into a spreadsheet to make them easy to find and easy to change. I’ve provided a handy template [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hLV4mrU52hZ822hjsRlQaMNTCaUT6GH2E9pLApTwFKc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Pose Lineups:** Create 9 duplicates of your model in kisekae and dress them down to each stage in order. Now you can hold every stage of a specific pose together in one save. 

**Kisekae Saves:** Create a “saves” folder within your Kisekae directory and get into the habit of using Kisekae’s save feature. Have a separate backup folder as well. 

**Wardrobe Codes:** Using the spreadsheet, create codes saving only the character’s wardrobe for each stage so that you can easily change the stage of any pose. Scale this up to [apply any changes to an entire Pose Lineup!](https://imgur.com/a/igz0k9O)

**Pose List Integration:** Using the spreadsheet, you can easily copy the codes over into the Character Editor’s pose list when you’re ready to import your images.

## Posing Spreadsheet

Most characters have their codes stored in text files. These are painful to work with, because it’s difficult to find and copy any specific pose within them, and they’re vulnerable to accidental changes or deletions. You could use the character editor’s pose list, but you still need to scroll through it to find the code you need, and you risk losing progress if you don’t save it correctly. 

I’ve created a template that you can start with [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hLV4mrU52hZ822hjsRlQaMNTCaUT6GH2E9pLApTwFKc/edit?usp=sharing). 

This spreadsheet contains two sheets: one for main poses, and one for extra poses that fall outside the main set. The first two columns and the first row are pinned so that you can always quickly tell which code belongs to what stage and pose. The “Wardrobe” column allows you to have easy access to each’s stages template code. More on this later. Both the “Stage” and “Wardrobe” columns will automatically transfer over from the “Main Poses” sheet to the “Other Poses Sheet,” so you don’t need to worry about inconsistencies if you choose to use both. 

If you aren’t very familiar with how Google Sheets or Excel works, see [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/ll0bTCy) for further details.

### Advantages to this Method:

* **Easy Access:** All of your poses are visible and easy to extract in one page with minimal scrolling.

* **Disaster Proof:** Your spreadsheet is stored on Google, so if your computer explodes you don’t lose your progress.

* **Version History:** Google saves every change you make, so you can access older versions without needing to hold onto 69 different saves of the same pose. 

* **Mistake Proof:** If you accidentally paste over or change a code, it’s easy to fix it using the version history feature. 

* **Collaboration Friendly:** Changes are saved in real time, so it’s very easy to collaborate without worrying about anyone having outdated codes.

### Things to Note:

* Cells are set to clip text-wrapping to keep the sheet clean. Occasionally this will break when a cell’s text wrapping setting is changed. Fix it by resetting it [here](https://i.imgur.com/4R85MoC.png). 
* Avoid leaving cells blank to prevent this problem; use a hyphen instead. 

* Changes made to the “Stage” and “Wardrobe” columns on the “Other Poses” sheet will not transfer to the “Main Poses” sheet. 
* Make sure these changes to these columns are made on the correct sheet. 

* This spreadsheet supports alternate costumes. Do this by duplicating and renaming the “Main Poses” sheet so that stages and wardrobes don’t transfer over from your default costume.  
* Renaming the “Main Poses” sheet will break the transfer of the “Stage” and “Wardrobe” columns to the “Other Poses” sheet. 
* Download the sheet from time to time so you still have access without an internet connection.

## Pose Lineups

Pose Lineups are a great way to build your poses to be easy to organize and modify later. You basically form a staged lineup for each emotion your character displays. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/JQU0mnQ.png) is Emi’s Happy lineup, for example. These can then be easily saved and loaded, which will be further explored in the next section. 

If your character has more than 9 stages, (like Emi) you can organize the extra poses by stage. Emi’s stage 10 Pose Lineups for example are organized and titled “Finished_Annoyed-Frustrated” and “Finished_Happy-Shocked.”

---

### Advantages to this Method:

* **Easy to Visualize:** No spreadsheet system can show you what the poses look like quickly and easily. This solves that problem. 
* **Easy to Build/Edit:** This method is the fastest way to build and modify a set of poses. It makes it easy to double up your poses, as Emi does, to cut your posing work in half. 
* **Consistency:** When you can see all of your Happy poses together at once, for example, it’s easier to tell if any of those poses look out of place. 

---

### Things to Note:

* If you are beginning your first character, I would recommend you keep every stage’s pose [the same for each given emotion.](https://i.imgur.com/WlZr5Kw.png) This will help simplify your efforts as you are starting out and learning the process. 
* This method is not compatible with poses that use global arms, belts, bows, or imports. You will need separate, individual saves for each of these. 
* Be sure to backup your Pose Lineups frequently. You *will* screw them up by accident. 
* In your documents folder, Kisekae makes a folder called "kkl-autosave." Every minute it makes a new save of what you currently have. (Thx Bagel)

## Kisekae Saves

Kisekae’s save/load is *immensely* more convenient than exporting/importing the entire stage, but I never used it for the longest time because I had no system in place to make it work smoothly. Don’t be stupid like me. Organize your saves. 

Start by placing a [saves folder](https://i.imgur.com/nIwKyAd.png) in your kisekae directory. Then make [folders for each character](https://i.imgur.com/WSELhBD.png) so that you don’t have a mess when you start working on another character. Then you can save each Pose Lineup [together in one place.](https://i.imgur.com/3PqNuxG.png)

Finally, **put a backup folder in each character folder!** It is *very* easy to accidentally save over a Pose Lineup when switching back and forth between them. You *will* do it. Get in the habit of copying your saves into the backup folder so you don’t lose hours of work when it happens. 

---

### Advantages to this Method:

* **Easy to Organize:** All of your work will be easy to find and keep track of. 
* **Good Habits:** Forces you to get in a habit of saving your work frequently and avoiding that dreaded disaster where you lose hours of progress. 
* **Faster Setup:** No hassle. Now you can just load up kisekae, load your latest save, and pickup right where you left off.  

---

### Things to Note:

* Did you backup your saves? No? Do it. 
* Kisekae will keep everything intact with each save, down to your zoom level, where your screen was moved to, and which characters you had selected. It even keeps hidden accessories and imports. 
* Kkl 97 has a bug where every character will be applied the default blush on startup. To fix this, select all characters, change the [blush setting](https://imgur.com/a/dOxEJzv), and then change it back to 10. 
* Do not touch the “Save-All” or “Load-All” buttons. 
* If you have a complicated model with tons of belts, bows, etc. your first save will take a few minutes to load, but switching between different Pose Lineups of that model won’t take very long. 
* If you leave the export window open for too long before copying the code, the code will sometimes change and break by including everything in the scene. 
* Have you backuped your saves yet?

## Wardrobe Codes

Wardrobe codes can be a very powerful tool. Paired with the spreadsheet and the previously discussed Pose Lineups, you can apply any model changes to your entire pose set in just a few minutes. 

Start by exporting codes that have [deselected the posing tabs](https://i.imgur.com/J9CxWPM.png) for each stage and pasting them accordingly into your spreadsheet. Now you may import these codes to easily change what stage your poses are in. This comes in handy when you screw up one of the poses in your lineup, or you wish to switch poses across stages. Some models have complicated belts or bows making up their outfits and these can be annoying to switch around otherwise. 

Next, you can create a master wardrobe code. This is done by selecting every stage in your lineup, and [exporting the code just the same.](https://i.imgur.com/PeyWNck.png) This code can then be imported to an entire Pose Lineup. You can even include background and reference image imports, so these can carry over to your pose changes as well. I like to place this master code below the rest of the wardrobe codes like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/ASrjGky.png) (Emi has 3 master codes because her legless poses are organized differently.) 

The master code allows you to make any changes to your model with only one import per emotion! No longer will you be afraid to improve your model because of the time it’ll take to apply it to every pose. You can see a step-by-step demonstration of this entire process [here.](https://imgur.com/a/igz0k9O)

---

### Advantages to this Method:

* **Easy Updating:** Updates can now be done to every pose in a fraction of the time. 
* **Easy Stage Switching:** Switch or fix a pose’s stage without messing with belts and bows. 
* **Easy Costumes:** Applying an alternate costume to your character can be done in a few minutes. 

---

### Things to Note:

* Pay close attention to which tabs you need to include in your wardrobe codes. Sometimes you may need to deselect additional tabs when importing to avoid overwriting a tab you wish to remain unchanged. 
* Save your Pose Lineup before importing wardrobe codes in case you make a mistake. 
* Master codes will typically take a long time to import unless they aren’t making many changes. Just sit back and let it do its thing.

## Pose List Integration

Now that you’re using a spreadsheet for your codes, getting them all into the Character Editor’s pose list will be a breeze. 

First, [create a dummy template](https://i.imgur.com/2ofvbJu.png) and click “Generate Pose List.” You can then head over to the poses tab and paste in your poses accordingly. You can even create a Macro to automate this process for you. (If you’re interested in how that works, let me know and I can go into more depth.) 

If you’re a new developer, and you took my advice to simplify your poses by making them all the same for each emotion, this process is made even easier by making an *actual template.* You already have wardrobe codes for the clothing section. For the pose codes, just export each emotion with [only the pose tabs selected.](https://i.imgur.com/AapkjlG.png) Now when you generate your pose-list, you’ll already be finished! 

Don’t forget to **save your pose list** once all of your codes are pasted in, so you do not have to redo this process later. I recommend including a version number in the file name to help organize them. 

---

### Advantages to this Method:

* **Simple:** Your work is already completed. Now you can paste the codes without worrying about the editor crashing and losing your work. 
* **Easy to Automate:** Because you’re using a spreadsheet to copy/paste your codes, you can create a macro to automate it very easily. All you need are clicks and keyboard presses to navigate the spreadsheet for each code. 
* **Redundant:** By following the other methods, you have multiple fail-safes in case something goes wrong during this process. 

---

### Things to Note:

* You can click on the Stage or Pose tabs in the Character Editor’s pose list window to sort your poses. The order they appear is the order they will import when you click “Import All.” This is handy when you’re only importing some stages/emotions. 
* The Character Editor will slow down between pastes the more codes you have in your paste list. Make sure you add sufficient delays between actions in your Macro to avoid making mistakes.
