            Each <front> element describes the paths to the card-front images for a card set.

            The `src` attribute describes a *pattern* of image paths, which the game will automatically
            fill in for each applicable card suit and rank for that front.

            Within the `src` attribute value, %s will be filled in with the card suit ID:
            - Spades: `spade`
            - Clubs: `clubs`
            - Diamonds: `diamo`
            - Hearts: `heart`

            %i will be filled in with the numerical rank of the card:
            - Ace: 1
            - number cards: the actual number (2 - 10)
            - Jack: 11
            - Queen: 12
            - King: 13

            The pattern `%s%i` therefore matches the naming scheme for the default cards:
            - Ace of Spades => `spade1`
            - 2 of Clubs => `clubs2`
            - Jack of Diamonds: `diamo11`
            - King of Hearts: `heart13`
            
            The `suit` attribute can be used to specify a space-separated list of suits to which this pattern applies.
            The suit name can be abbreviated: "diamonds", "diamo", and "d" all refer to the suit of diamonds, for example.
            Suit names are also case-insensitive.
            By default, if no `suit` is provided, the pattern is assumed to apply to all suits.

            The `rank` attribute can be used to specify the card ranks to which this pattern applies.
            This uses the usual interval notation.
            Aces are considered to be both rank 1 and rank 14: "1-13" and "2-14", therefore, refer to all possible card ranks.
            By default, patterns are assumed to apply to all card ranks.

            Multiple <front> elements can be listed, to describe multiple image path patterns.
            If a given card has multiple possible image paths, it is undefined which one is actually used.
            Card sets do not need to be complete: you don't have to have an image for every card in a suit, and you don't have to fill in all suits.
        -->

        <!--
            Examples:

            Specify an image for the Ace of Spades in particular:
            <front suit="spade" rank="14" src="img/my-cards/ace_of_spades.jpg" />

            Specify images for Jacks, Queens, and Kings only (of all suits):
            <front rank="11-13" src="img/my-cards/%s%i.jpg" />

            Specify images for Hearts only (of all ranks):
            <front suit="hearts" src="img/my-cards/%s%i.jpg" />
        -->

        <front src="img/cards/default/%s%i.jpg" />

        <!--
            Each <back> element lists the path to a single card back image.
            Each back image needs an ID that is unique within the set (though IDs can be re-used in different sets).
            Multiple card back images can be listed in a single set.

            A <collectible> element can be used to tie a card set to a collectible, so that
            unlocking the collectible unlocks the card set for use as well.

            "character" should be the ID of the character with the collectible,
            and "id" should be the collectible's ID.
