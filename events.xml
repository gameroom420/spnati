            Event Dates:
            Events can be configured to automatically begin and end on certain dates by adding
            the <dates> element.

            The <dates> element can contain <date> elements that specify each scheduled date
            range that the event will activate on.
            Multiple date ranges can be specified (for example, for events that change dates across different years).

            Events can also be manually activated by changing a setting in config.xml and/or prod-config.xml.
            If no dates are specified for an event, it can only be activated manually.
        -->
        <dates>
            <date>
                <!-- 
                    The <from> element specifies the start date of the event.
                    The month and day must both be specified.

                    The year is optional; if the year is omitted, the event is assumed to repeat every year
                    at the same month and day.

                    The <to> element, on the other hand, specifies the end date of the event.
                    This can be given as:
                    - A month/day year (with optional year)
                    - A number of days after the start date.

                    The first option uses `year`, `month`, and `day` attributes; similarly to the <from> element,
                    if the year is omitted, the date is assumed to repeat every year.
                    The end date itself is included as part of the date range in this case.

                    The second option uses the `days` attribute to specify the length of time the event should last,
                    starting from the date specified in the <from> element. 

                    This particular event is scheduled every year, starting July 1 and lasting for 14 days.

                    The end date of an event can also be omitted entirely; the event is then assumed to last for exactly one day.

                    Date ranges (both repeating and one-shot) can cross over into a new year if desired.
                    For example, <from month="12" day="20" /> and <to month="1" day="5" /> specifies
                    a repeating date range starting December 20 of each year and ending on January 5 of the next year.
                    Date ranges specified as a start date and a length in days can also cross over into different years.
                -->
                <from month="7" day="1" />
                <to days="14" />
            </date>

            <date override="true">
                <!-- 
                    Repeating date ranges and year-specific date ranges aren't mutually exclusive.
                    For example, a "rerun" of an event outside of the usual repeating dates can be scheduled
                    by adding another, one-shot date range with years specified.

                    Additionally, adding `override="true"` to a date range will cause that date range
                    to override other date ranges for that year.

                    To be specific: when a date range is marked as an override, it will take priority
                    over all other date ranges for that year (and that year only).
                    Other date ranges not marked as overrides will not be checked during years where
                    overrides are scheduled.

                    Multiple override ranges can be listed (either for different years, or for the same year).

                    This can be used to reschedule, shorten, or lengthen an event during a particular year.

                    This override, for example, shortens the 2019 Summer Event to end on July 7, instead of July 14.

                    NOTE: these are just examples, and are not meant to be indicative of actual scheduling.

            The <costumes>, <tag>, and <character> elements can all have the following optional attributes:
            - "highlight"
            - "partition"
            - "sort"
            - "prefill"
            - "testing-guest"

            Per-character settings (<character> elements) take priority over all others.
            Per-costume settings (<costume> elements) are used next.
            Finally, per-tag settings (<tag> elements) are used last.

            Furthermore, if multiple overlapping events set an attribute for a character, then the value
            from the topmost overlapping event will be applied.

            The "highlight" attribute can be used to apply special roster highlighting (such as Valentine's
            Day highlighting or sponsorship highlighting) to matching characters.

            The "partition" and "sort" attributes can be used to change how characters are sorted on the roster:
             - Characters are first grouped into partitions based on their "partition" attribute (higher partition numbers are placed first).
             - Characters within a partition are then sorted based on their "sort" attribute (higher sort values go first).
             - Characters with identical "partition" and "sort" values are then sorted by position in listing.xml.

            Note that by default, all characters are placed in partition 0.
            Negative partition values are supported, and will be placed after non-event characters in the roster.

            By default, the following sort values are used:
            - Characters with event costumes are given a sort value of 3.
            - Characters with event tags are given a sort value of 2.
            - Other specifically-listed characters in an event are given a sort value of 1.
            - Non-event characters are given a sort value of 0.

            Overlapping events share partition and sorting values; for example, short-term "highlighting" events
            can temporarily set a character to have a higher partition value than normal in order to push them
            higher in the roster, while other events are running.

            Event characters can be configured to be prioritized when selecting prefill characters
            by setting `prefill="force"`. Setting `prefil="default"` will move characters to the default
            pool of characters for prefilling (as configured in `config.xml`).

            By default, if no explicit prefill settings are applied, characters with event costumes or tags
            will be force-prefilled, while other listed characters for the event will not (they will be relegated
            to the default prefill pool).

            Note that, if there aren't enough event characters to completely fill the selection screen slots
            (i.e. if there are less than four event characters configured to be force-prefilled), then 
            the remaining slots will be prefilled with characters from the default prefilling pool.

            The "testing-guest" attribute can be set to "true" or "false", to either show or hide matching
            characters that are in Testing on the main roster screen.
            
            By default, Testing characters with event costumes are not allowed to appear on the main roster;
            neither are other event characters (i.e. characters with event tags, or that are specifically listed).
            Note that this attribute only applies to Testing characters, specifically.

            <!--
                The `year`, `month`, and `day` attributes are used to specify a
                "reference date" for the event, while the `start-on` attribute
                specifies on which day of the week the event will start (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.).

                Finally, the `days` attribute specifies how many days the date range
                will cover.

                The actual start and end dates of the event will be calculated such that:
                 - the start date is strictly before the reference date
                 - the start date falls on the specified day of the week
                 - the date range covers the reference date, if the given length
                 allows for it.

                This particular example specifies that this event should start on
                the Sunday before February 14 and last for two weeks.

                In 2022, the Valentine's Day event would begin at midnight on Sunday, February 13 and end at midnight on Sunday, Feburary 27.
                in 2023, the Valentine's Day event would begin at midnight on Sunday, February 12 and end at midnight on Sunday, Feburary 26.
                In 2021, since 02/14 falls on a Sunday, the Valentine's Day event would instead start on February 7 and end on February 21,
                instead of starting right at 02/14.

                Note that if the length of the range is less than 8 days, the event may not last long enough to actually cover
                the reference date.

                By default, if `start-on` and/or `days` are not specified, the date range will start on a Sunday
                and last for 8 days.

                <date> and <weekOf> can both be used at the same time in an event.
                <weekOf> elements can also be marked with `override="true"`; this works the same way as date range overrides.
                As with regular <date> ranges, both repeating and one-shot <weekOf> ranges can also cross over into different years if desired.

    <!--
        This event defines a resort; the resort-specific data is contained in the <resort> section.

        <season> specifies the season of the resort; aside from the actual name of the relevant season,
        it can be omitted or set to "auto", to automatically determine it from the event start date.

        For the purposes of determining the season of a resort,
        Winter is December - February, Spring is March - May, Summer is June - August, and Autumn is September - November.
        All of these ranges are inclusive.

        <poll> specifies the link to the public poll for this resort; people will be linked there when
        clicking on the "Roster Re-Sort Poll" button in the resort announcement dialog.

        <min-characters> specifies the minimum number of played characters needed to show the resort dialog.
        If not specified, the threshold is set to 40 by default.
        
        If consistent-timezone is set to true, the event will start and end at the same time all over the world,
        as opposed to standard events, which use the user's timezone (so that, for instance, Halloween ends on exactly
        midnight on Halloween night for everyone.)
        
        Set consistent-timezone to true for all re-sorts and other non-holiday events.

    <!--
        This event includes an announcement that will pop up on screen when the player enters the selection screen,
        similarly to the resort notification dialog (though without the played characters requirement).

        Announcement headers and bodies can contain arbitrary HTML.
        The `event-announcement-link` CSS class can be used for prominent button links
        (similarly to the "Re-Sort Poll" button in the Resort modal).

        Like the resort dialog, announcements will normally only be shown to the player once.
        However, they can also be accessed via a dropdown on the title bar.

        If a re-sort is active and other events have announcements, the re-sort dialog will be
        displayed first (if the character threshold is met and the dialog has not been previously seen),
        followed squentially by the other events' announcements, in file order (top of this file to the bottom).

        If an active resort is the only available announcement, then the regular "Re-Sort Poll" button will
        be shown on the title bar.
        However, if a resort is active at the same time as another announcement, then the button to view the
        re-sort poll dialog will instead be moved to the Announcements dropdown.

        <min-characters> specifies the minimum number of played characters needed to show the announcement;
        this works exactly the same as the resort dialog threshold.

        By default, however, the played character threshold for regular announcements is set to 0, allowing all
        players to see them.
